feeling more comfortable with recursion', 'it starts with very low pace but after midterm it gets really fast i cannot understand content while reaching end term racket is restricted by so many things so i feel i lose freedom coding assignments are extremely hard after midterm i spent whole day them but i can just solve easiest one only positive impression that i have is that design recipe weighs half so i pass this course successfully', 'took this 2018 with no programming experience ever started out pretty slow but i didnt really pay attention was severely behind went lot office hours but nonetheless caught up did decently well after taking more cs courses racket really is weird language', 'i loved everything about cs 115 great instructors fair assignments can get tricky but theres huge amount office hours attend good engagement interesting topics its seriously well structured i would recommend it anyone even with no background coding', 'i recommend finding course with language that is actually useful racket is dumb never used anywhere majority course was quite easy except couple concept checks that were ridiculously hard i wish i had realized sooner that you get 10 concept checks dropped your grade if you understand everything are getting most things easily but you get stumped one particular concept check its probably not your fault you should skip it at least now course was very well structured predictable expectations were clear reasonable it actually was designed be correspondence course so it wasnt online course that was rushed slapped together covid', 'i really enjoyed this course online being co taught by 4 professors there were lots office hours available help all tas profs office hours were helpful kind while programming language used is not useful elsewhere i think it is easy understand helped get point course across my opinion point this course is teach you think about solving problems process go through as you are not creating ground breaking programs as student with no prior programming experience i found this course both useful easy if you kept up with content got help as soon as you needed it course was organized well built questions made sure you were right track assignments are fair based what you learn go with open mind keep up with content you should be just fine', 'math student who took this course since i had 0 prior programming experience course isnt horribly hard but if you fall behind or dont understand one lesson everything following will be super challenging course was mostly online completing modules my biggest criticism is that solutions lessons are never posted after they are due which makes it super challenging do next weeks module if you didnt understand didnt know how write specific code week racket language used this course is easy follow but not very useful isnt used anywhere this makes it difficult find help outside cs115 profs tas past cs115 students course is oddly paced felt super easy simple first half course then gets unreasonably fast didnt find any profs tas answers questions posted discussion boards useful at all because course was only offered online i had essentially had teach whole course myself', 'only way do bad this course is by not managing ur time properly this is mistake i made when we had work with modules as long as u properly manage ur time do assignments concept checks well before due date you will have great time this course also try finding connections between assignments try finding some real world applications racket trust me racket is very useful only criticism i have this course is how course is taught because it wasnt taught this is when i did online i had understand all concepts by myself by basically reading texts although there was plenty opportunity like office hours ask help i only realized that towards end term very unfortunate', 'can be difficult at times but very rewarding fun course definitely made me like cs as non cs student start assignments early definitely go office hours tas isas are very helpful', 'this course is taught archaic language that no one uses no one understands instructors explanations are irrelevant actual questions i got yelled during office hrs even though i stated that i need little patience i am disabled assignments quizzes are unreasonably hard i took take this bioinformatics option decided change my future career truly worst uw history if you dont need this course run', 'not bird course although if you have background programming it would not be difficult at all racket is somewhat useless but i learned some concepts that will be useful other programming languages', 'i took this course online due covid 19 pandemic so my review is based remote online learning experience overall as someone who is not cs student who doesnt have lot background experience knowledge programming its great introductory course language racket overall concepts that will be useful later computer science courses racket language itself is not very useful language that you may or may not use later cs courses even job but foundation it provides is very valuable will definitely make you think more mathematically at programming problems difficulty this course starts increase after midterm exam it does get pretty tough nearing end i recommend starting assignments as early as possible attend as many office hours if you have any questions course staff are very responsive do offer good amount help depending your questions overall i cant say much about person learning experience but this course was suited well online learning i enjoyed it', 'i found online this course be fantastic personally edx is clearly organized content isnt too difficult but provides challenge cant speak person but would definitely recommend online beware though as this course is time consuming because amount problems assignments shouldnt be mixed with term that is already fairly difficult', 'this was joint taught by bunch profs winter term i think it was one most organized online courses i took content modules were all written but there was bunch integrated questions check your understanding course is really centered your ability reach out help when you need it since everything was asynchronous i think my favourite part was how office hours were 1 1 there were lot times available throughout day only thing is that some nicer tas had really long wait times lol overall super enjoyable though just make sure base your design recipe their given examples or you will lose many marks', 'i think this course ran well online notes were very organized easy enough follow along there is good support most proffs tas course may be little fast complete cs beginner but course has 400 practice questions help prepare weekly assignments', 'its worst course ever online especially they are least interested teach they just provided content read by ourselves i wouldnt suggest anyone take this course online', 'nice course that teaches you how write simple code but little annoying that you have do design recipe especially writing explanation codes there is no loop drracket so being able understand recursion is important all course contents are based website you have read everything code something that website pity that this course will not show many algorithms or data structures so far i think those who can just play computer games i e no coding experience but can easily type using keyboard can easily get 90 this course if you have ever coded like c python java pascal so easy get 95 idk why easy rate goes so low but trust me super easy course if you finish reading material okay reading part may be little boring cs 135 provide detailed intros which seem not wordy', 'it was okay all i can say is do your work submit assessments time please dont procrastinate thats what i did i live regret it this is because figuring out solutions each assessment problem takes time procrastinating doesnt help so submit early submit often submit submit', 'end course became quite tough but otherwise this was pretty manageable excellent professors isas who always take our feedback concerns into consideration make course experience better including having office hours very late at night very early morning online platform is also excellent fun use', 'education quality is significantly impaired with no doubt since we are doing it online reviews before covid was mostly positive but after covid 19 lot them are negative i think that reflects something assignment were thrown into your face like you just have one class whole term me i believe material we learn assignment we need do is inconsistent terms difficulty level gap between them is just huge it often took me eight twelve hours finish assignment dont take this if you are doing online', 'so difficult beginners', 'not easy course at all anyone commentating that is probably math eng student who is already familiar with coding through other courses since midterm exam is paper you have be able imagine what your code is going be able do without actually testing it like you do your assignments speaking assignment theyre bloody hard no joke it might take you entire day problem solve your way through them that might not even be enough incredibly frustrating course not recommended unless you really want study coding future dr racket is not even applicable most organizations if you want learn coding just pick up something off amazon or get pdf through friend dont spend money here unless youre actually planning continuing studies cs', 'must attend lectures if youre new programming', 'pretty easy course overall i stopped going labs about three weeks still managed get bonus 3 assignments were relatively easy with one or two exceptions', 'very easy course if you keep up with material do assignments', 'its hard motivate yourself do assignments when each is 2 or something but it really is important keep top it they only get harder arguably only way guarantee that youll do well midterm since you will be asked write mini programs i personally found exam be much harder than midterm so you really need use midterm as grade booster', 'reviewing as science major this course was definitely one that set me up with programming even though it was dr racket concepts were easy follow be sure go ask lot questions if you do not understand', 'good start cs though racket seems useless future study', 'racket sucks but content course was easy enough digest if you never did programming before seek help if you need it early dont be afraid talk tas profs', 'great course but little strange if youre used object oriented programming', 'this course was my favorite first year its really fun i enjoyed writing codes lot', 'it you get stuck assignment take break revisit later dont let assignments become time sink', 'well racket it is ok', 'i hate racket', 'really easy i had no previous coding experience i picked it up concepts super quickly you have go class though slides are not enough', 'cs 115s content wasnt too hard is very accessible first time coders be prepared sometimes have put good chunk time weekly assignments but assignments help you out lot with problem solving skills becoming more comfortable with coding general', 'so easy didnt pay attention lectures just used course notes', 'if you feel like you have sufficient computer science experience go cs 135 because it does challenge you more this is good introductory course learn programming also racket needs some getting used', 'interesting gg', 'take cs 135 or 145 if you have prior programming experience majority this course is exceedingly easy if you already know programming basics it may only possibly get difficult at very end design recipe

'its pretty much introduction computer science concepts like recursion bsts other abstract data types its very useful if you have no prior experience with programming', 'do not take this as elective unless coding math is easy you there are lot concepts impossible teach yourself course notes because how poorly organized they are lectures are impossibly boring my best friend tutors this class i still justtttt scraped by language is not super useful life many my friends have taken this course because they heard it was easy ended up failing', 'was nice way learn recursion which is essentially purpose this course they also give lot free marks with 3 lab bonus do them that 3 can make big difference your mark', 'fuck i hate design recipe your lose marks nothing', 'i have never coded before so i opted take this rather than cs135 this was really easy me im glad i took it though becuase it saved time so i can focus more actual courses my major math145 phys121 etc dont expect be able code anything after this especial since you use dr raket design recipes are pain my tip is put 20 test cases everything', 'thanks keiko katsuragawa prof who doesnt know how type properly or speak english

op that is', 'elementary course cs have fun', 'read coursenote only go class clicker questions', 'really easy course especially if you have coded before assignments get little harder at end but both

with no history writing programs this was very cool course lectures were difficult pay attention but i liked overall skill set i came out course with also learned that coding can be very frustrating you can easily get stuck at road block significant amounts time yet very rewarding no better feeling than finally getting your program run', 'good course my first cs course', 'course was relatively easy but midterm was setup poorly focus was not core concepts but exactness stepping problems which i dont think is useful at all', 'i had no programming experience before this class it still wasnt too hard most part good elective some assignments were tricky but exams were easy', 'weekly assignments are not worth much but are difficult weekly labs 1 midterm 1 final doing labs will greatly help with assignments asking questions tas prof will help lot', 'pretty easy straight forward introductory cs course people complain but scheme syntax but personally i dont mind prefix notation at all', 'didnt like it i was lucky i passed', 'awesome course isnt too difficult like cs 135 but actually teaches you some good things if youre looking not too difficult cs course this is it right here make sure leave few hours aside get through assignments they can be bit tricky easy exams', 'never taken anything even remotely related this was super easy read modules take couple hours each week do assignments easy enough midterm final', 'genuinely easy course', 'easy course', 'so easy just follow course notes it literally tells you how do everything you need do assignments take some time so leave few hours aside them otherwise this class is super easy', 'since i had prior programming experience this course seemed kind useless language is good teaching though', 'good introductory course into cs imo cs 100 doesnt count because its about making ancient website or something like that little difficult at first but once you get into it get into cs way thinking its pretty easy it also gives you better appreciation stuff programmers do allows you understand their work better', 'programming language scheme dr racket wasnt very good program use but concepts behind it are same i guess', 'go tas extra help they offer free private sessions class is not so bad even first time computer science students', 'interesting easy once you get hang it', 'easiest', 'starting course cs

probably wont take more upper years its good know basics', 'work only scheme', 'course was not very hard language used was scheme which i did not like found it be very tedious it is not as fun as other languages course however was good overall', 'welcome waterloo math', 'pretty useful first year math courses generally basically all them have proofs some sort this course teaches you how handle

hard', 'course notes textbook make this class breeze make sure you fully understand theorems lemmas etc if you want do well', 'easy course understand all proof theories you will get high mark this course easily', 'pretty challenging course someone coming out standard high school curriculum bunch theorems that you need know when where apply logical thinking this course taught is useful throughout your undergrad degree', 'most disgusting piece content that i have ever learnt my life this course is so useless unnecessarily complicated lectures are often useless because instead actually explaining how solve problems whole lecture is wasted proving random theorems that we will never be expected prove if you do bad midterm dont give up as content gets much better next term which means it is still possible you recover your mark as far as i saw first part course is tough wrap your head around most people but post midterm content is more computational easier understand if you can take course online then do it since assignments quizzes are weighted higher exams are online as well', 'this course is introduction proofs i remember it being very difficult grasp some concepts i spent long time assignments but what you learn this course is quite important upper years i took it fall 2020 online', 'i wouldnt say it was easy course but it is definitely manageable

course but if you read textbook do lots lots practice problems you will be fine', 'read textbook it is godsend', 'its kind hard students who are 1a term because it takes time get used this course assignments are always much harder than content which needs be improved', 'lot proves bit calculation i really think this is easier than 138', 'by far most interesting course 1a teaching proof techniques is main focus course is done quite well but all topics that we touched gcd complex numbers modular arithmetic were interesting too one assignment week which usually took 3 6 hours plus three mobius quizzes week open 24 hours each midterm was challenging but still fair final was much easier my only regret is not taking math 145 instead if you are anywhere near euclid score cutoff you should apply advanced courses instead you will likely find 135 be fairly easy', 'this course teaches proof techniques which i assume that will be used lot future math courses ended with lots calculation it was neither hard nor hard but i learned how manage time wisely took some time get used first year university math tho', 'i think math 135 is crucial course if youre doing anything proof related it lays foundation proofs which will be needed throughout uni if youre doing any math related program its not easiest course so pay attention lectures ask question practice practice practice',

making comeback final is 100 possible', 'hard but study then not hard but might still be hard', 'definitely challenging course especially if you have no prior experience with writing formal proofs just make sure that you practice concepts by finding question banks online youll be fine', 'interesting material but truly quite difficult takes lot practice especially before major assessments so keeping top assignments quizzes helps lot', 'this is very well organized course which is great since it is likely your first introduction proofs which will be absolutely central any future math courses you take take note that math this course is very different high school math will probably require you shift your thinking about mathematics one computation one puzzle solving make sure start weekly assignments early since they can be little unpredictable how long they take also every lecture day there is 24 window complete mobius quiz which cumulatively count 10 your grade so remember do them they can be easy forget', 'learned lot how properly write proofs different mathematical ways thinking if you were even bit serious about contest maths high school this course is easy 90 also anton is just absolutely goated if you have chance join one his lectures or even just read his lecture notes', 'interesting topic first time seeing proofs like this maybe useful upper year math courses very difficult person but online is much easier grading is unfair depends prof some profs gave extra bonus questions etc pick anton s class if you can he is best', 'this is really great interesting course there is lot learning do you do need very consistent work ethic order keep up with course content practice makes perfect', 'this course teaches completely new concept most proofs once you understand how build proof course gets easier however some students never figure that part out i think pacing course is really well my biggest piece advice is do assignments by yourself struggling through failing is how you learn this is what will allow you figure out exactly what theorems techniques use when which is key doing well overall i personally really enjoyed proofs by end course as it is refreshing way look at mathematics if you truly love math you will love this course that being said course is very professor dependent so different professors provide very different experiences this course', 'really interesting course makes you explore whole new way understanding mathematics unfortunately if youre person only 20 your grade is assignments quizzes other 80 is midterm final makes it really demotivating at times because each assignment is only 1 your grade', 'its overload information tbh but i can see why its useful this is one those practice makes perfect courses', 'good intro proofs', 'i found this course be very challenging might have been because i did not like my profs teaching style proofs were nothing i have done or seen before so math135 was very new me textbook isnt very useful learn how come up with proofs that were any assessments weekly assignments were extremely difficult took average student around 5 10 hours week complete weekly quizzes were good assess textbook understanding as someone who struggled this course i have say responses piaaza were essentially useless when i asked questions about course content their response everything was direct quotation textbook or if they were feeling extra lazy would just say look at course notes', 'this course is great anyone that is interested math it is quite different high school math courses as it is whole new way approaching mathematical problems course goes over techniques proofs which are building blocks many future math courses later half course goes over some number theory i found it sufficiently challenging but still interesting terms course load there are weekly assignments but they are not too bad if you start early you are allowed ask instructors help be warned that exams are fairly difficult though overall great course any math enthusiasts take', 'as extremely average student who is not especially good at math i found this course be both very fun bit challenging some content is hard understand at first but as long as you keep grinding out practice problems spamming questions piazza you will be fine i strongly believe that any student that just puts time effort will succeed', 'beginning term this course felt very useless however that was most childish wanna be theoretical physicist can tell himself lot what you will learn this course will be useful as it will be foundation mathematics you will need solve lot theoretical physics problems lot what u learn this course is also useful proving equations u derive as physicist you will learn things like complex numbers methods proof binomial theory summations repeated multiplications all these concepts are useful example when we try approximate equations physics good understanding summations is required binomial theory may be used expand relativistic kinetic energy equation lets say u as mathematical physicist derived equation some how now u want make sure that equation is valid basic knowledge what u learn this course may be helpful complex numbers can be spotted schrodingers wave equation if u are serious about physics dont take this course lightly although this might be over exaggeration but i feel like this course is as important as calculus so calculus you will be asked derive taylor polynomials how will you do that without basic understanding summations although science mathematical physics students donot have take this course before taking math 136 linear algebra honours math this course is very useful math 136 proof techniques you learn this course like proof by strong induction may be useful linear algebra all physics enthusiasts know importance linear algebra physics one can finish most math 137 calculus assignments without having look at lectures i donot recommend this get good grade you cannot even solve first question math 135 before fully understanding all concepts lectures i personally very much disliked this course mostly because math learned was very new compared what i was taught school it was difficult understand these ideas but i did enjoy learning about new concepts but i understand that content taught is very important therefore if u are apprising physicist take course seriously if u like pure math take this course seriously if u like cs take this course seriously if u like finance take this course seriously if u like painting take this course seriously u need understand golden ratio figure out how make ur art perfect regardless ur major please dont undermine value this course provides this course sucks no doubt but it is hella useful so pay attention class do all assignments even though u can drop one criticism i would have with this course is lack applications although this course content has many applications course is designed way that suggests that there is none except pure math i would like that change if possible please make physics based math135 math 136 please thankyou', 'incredibly helpful anyone who wants develop more profound understanding fundamental components algebra', 'most difficult course my 1a really suffered', 'course is hard but definitely manageable dont stress over assignments because they are worth so little rather you should try understand content much deeper level that goes long way', 'this course is all about writing proofs most concepts were super interesting but writing proofs was challenging course is designed really well as each chapter flows into next so you really understand connections do assignments yourself try do extra practice before midterms finals i personally loved this course', 'i have never thought or seen math like this before high school being introduced this course has definitely expanded my horizons how i see mathematics being applied world it is challenging course some concepts are hard wrap your mind around however with practice it is doable course structure is great course is well maintained by faculty', 'my opinion one best run courses does great job introducing new perspective math', 'its new way mathematical thinking most i personally found it really fun fascinating', 'its great course well organized

mathematical logic which you will see again cs 245 then second half goes into elementary number theory stuff prime numbers division theorem modulo complex numbers weekly assignments were tough i always do them 2 or 3 days before deadline so it was not nice experience at all so my tip is start them asap get help instructor or ta whenever you get dead stuck i regret not going office hours had

what others have said pre midterm this class is really not tough fact my advice would be squeeze all marks you can pre midterm by doing this you are able save your dropped assignment second half when assignments become lot harder you can go into exam being able pass course with fail exam also go office hours start assignments early theyre great help', 'fun but topics get too abstract nearing end

great you think its soft but you just keep coming up as it progresses intensity only increases can become overwhelming you may not like it if you dont like your prof i would recommend skipping your

not math faculty assignments are brutal complete as they require so much time figure out but i would advise everyone do them all their own as theyre there you develop thinking you need succeed anyone

skills can lead you finding more time work assignments such as 10 minutes between lectures solutions will often feel like it comes down lucky guess general professors are pretty amazing math faculty doesnt send random people with thick accents teach all their first year courses even if you do fail theres still 10 more sections winter term where they mark easier 2 more sections spring where exams

i felt i couldnt do it really just one my favourite courses ive ever taken', 'it is definitely one most interesting courses my first year as it is course that has most new content compared other

regarding content covered days leading up midterm despite its unpopularity among undergrads midterm quiz contains only ten multiple choice questions each worth 20 or 10 marks length question since course content prior midterms is centred around advanced stoichiometry that involves setup system linear equations form foundation solving it becomes increasingly difficult make sense how you are supposed approach questions quiz lot them involve highly structured calculations where chance committing error increase due fact entire quiz is multiple choice even minor error calculation can lead you wrong final answer which if included list responses can deliver false hope if not you will end up spending 20 minutes trying locate error which can be likened finding needle haystack case that ever happens you move next question yes you may have instantly pulverized 20 marks but what can you do course content after midterms is whole different story that is when topics covered appear be more relevant our program at least more straightforward comprehend unfortunately final exam is still entirely multiple choice source frustration many but our professors were generous enough allow us redeem ourselves by setting up stupendously simple straightforward final exam that allowed us compensate our poor performance midterm finally final is non inclusive content covered during lectures leading up

teaches very well', 'this course ugh it is def hard course but if you put time you can do well i just hate how at start course prof conrad who runs course had soooo many bs requirements signing integrity statements how it must be done pencil or you have write out entire page by hand stupid assignments worth 1 course notes janelles lectures were my primary way learning janelle is goat conrad ruined it most students i think this course had potential being fun but disorganization by course leads bs piazza rules overall shitty experience made me hate this course we cant even express our thoughts piazza without getting banned team only marked half our 1 assignments without telling us which ones at one points which started fuss piazza at one point this was def my most time consuming course with enough effort i ended off with 95 but i hated this course', 'tough course especially around end but its possible do well if you put time effort', 'took this course online winter 2021 be honest if it was not janelles lectures i might have failed this class but ended up with 79 which might not be very good mark but im super proud since i thought i would fail praise janelle shes such

forward math 235', 'is this really your signature', 'manageable course if you put work assessments include computational components theory components proofs really enjoyed it anton was great teacher',

through this course lots content gets thrown at you especially towards end pay attention class make sure you understand theorems can do proofs really enjoyed course prof', 'easy course i like it',

hard course overall', 'it was really fun course that expanded proof methods that we learned 135 calculations were straight forward easy but proofs near end chapter problems end examinations require

are so hard i already cant imagine dimensions but with proofs i wanna die lol proofs are harder than math 135', 'this course teaches you very very abstract mathematics generalization things into vector spaces seems very difficult visualize it requires you study well have great intuition about why lot things make sense this is why most students find this course difficult it requires effort

again fall 2016 midterm was very straightforward so was final i studied everything did most practice problems course went well i got 60 math 135 math 136 got me used doing proofs my tips make flashcards every definition theorem actually understand theorems then practice questions textbook reinforce concepts get your hands solutions textbook so you can see how proofs are modeled it will

everything you need but some weeks videos were scuffed that they assumed you had knowledge that you didnt have yet these cases id recommend taking look textbook greg rices person weekly tutorials were

based rather than strictly proof based course notes are quite useful there are lot practise problems they give you that will help you feel more prepared exam even your upcoming assignments i really like that course notes are detailed as well with that being said here are things i did not like about course course is basically teach it yourself course there are weekly mini lectures you can watch which provide maybe 30 40 lesson where as youre expected read course notes as well because just going off mini lectures will not help you with much quizzes unfortunately meaning that there are quiz topics that arent covered mobius but that are discussed notes assignments they arent bad they are just annoying since lot it is done r i am more solve by hand guy rather than software what i mainly did not like about course again was fact it was more self learning course that there werent any live classes or extra weekly live tutorials online students make sure study hard midterm final because there are lot questions time they give you', 'took this course online fall 2021 content before mid term was relatively easy digestible however content after midterm at least me became progressively

me feel worth taking', 'not easy course but not hard either i would say this is definitely easier than math 138 though concepts were not super interesting since i really only enjoy applied cs stuff hahaha but it was not dry boring either one aspect i really liked about this course is that it is applied there were not any proof questions whatsoever which was superb if you enjoy something applied are at least somewhat interested data science you would enjoy this course my complaint about this course is that it felt like you literally self taught yourself this course instructors will not help you assignments at least my offering there were lecture video weekly recap but i found course note be your best bet learn materials as it explained concepts thoroughly with so many examples practice problems which make me happy since some math class just assume you know lot or are proficient enough at math def not me haha overall quite decent course', 'easy until some point then it becomes just too complicated my little brain definitely useful though', 'i really hated way this course was run spring 2021 instructors were useless please do not take this course if any these three profs are

terribly difficult course material is relatively interesting lectures are clear tons notes available', 'i will be super honest with this course this course is actually very useful can be relatively easy when compared with other tough courses such as math239 but it sure isnt easy or less demanding you must study good chunk it every week ace weekly quizzes study lots before exams get ace exams as well if you want 95 my advice is not watch lectures too long just read course notes as they are explained more detail contain some great advanced questions that will get you prepared hard questions that you may encounter quizzes or exams assignments are very straightforward so do not stress too much by amount they are quite long but make sure you study lots because they are actually useful will

not good at counting otherwise i enjoyed other content we did except indicator variables if you study hard read notes especially do prof naghams questions you can get good grade', 'i really liked

course is very mixed between people some people find it extremely easy get 90 while others find it extremely difficult barely pass probability seems be more intuitive some people its quite different

challenging enjoyable', 'fuck this course it was just complete drag', 'easy until final but final was nothing like sample finals so it hit hard take it with diana if you can', 'really didnt like how

them all fit together first 3 assignments were very straightforward simple final 2 ramped up difficulty mainly due debugging memory leaks difficulty this course lies with insane amount time you have put each assignment i found that 1st assignment i spent about 6 7 hours it assignment 2 3 had me spending about 10 12 assignment 4 5 were between 17 20 hours sheer scale assignments as they progressed was primary cause increased time difficulty though didnt really scale all that much i would advise caution final project you will be better suited with either selecting game that is done individually or choosing group 3 individual games are meant be done by single person group games are not nor should they be by 2 people as i had somehow my partner i finished our group game week half when it was

had so far', 'difficulty one hand content is really simple it takes no time understand other hand assignments are so goddamn long no amount skill cs14x or ap java has saved me this monkey grinding

sense time management absolute hell if you dont if youre here though you probably have take this course anyway so just do it if you put time youll learn lot midterm was absolutely brutal filled with

unfortunately i couldnt see what i did wrong that as they dont release what you got right wrong mobius like they did tests so thats unfortunate but still 90 is good mark i assume i might have made few clumsy mistakes like with 2nd test also make sure do all participation challenges assignments time regardless whether or not assignments are due at end term as they were super useful tests exams i really mean they were super useful make sure question everything you dont understand dont be afraid reach out piazza or even message prof try expand your knowledge i even was able schedule teams meetings with dr sciana shoutout him as extra practice at ends screencasts i would actually heavily reccomend dont stress ton feel need do them immediately but rather actually preferably leave them until you start studying tests exams as they will be new questions content that you might have forgot bit about then they will be great study tools help test your knowledge as you dont have that sorta

terrible but all other units were basically grade 12 chemistry with small new pieces information so those units werent difficult piazza was really helpful really got me through this course its great platform asks questions so i would suggest using that this is type courses were you need spend at least 2 weeks prior test reviewing all units you cant cram last minute that doesnt work this course you seriously need know your stuff so use tools they provide dont be scared email prof or tas about questions ask peers help if you do all that youll do well this course', 'good course but hardest

didnt already know that stuff or didnt remember it it wouldve been difficult as it was pretty brief this course was probably more difficult me than it needed be because i got behind lectures didnt take time do practice questions would recommend putting effort', 'did it online would highly recommend not doing so if you have choice course online version had optional weekly challenges optional

one prof that kept talking about history chem rather than explaining lessons', 'taken remotely due covid make sure keep up with content there are several professors this course they each have their

tested', 'very controversial class regards its difficulty but all honesty majority it is gr 11 12 review keep your notes these grades i took this class online during covid 19 watched maybe 5 lectures rest i caught onto gr 11 12 notes course notes provided i personally did not use textbook other than cite reference 120l study exam course is scary little intimidating but push through it is

hybridization etc good luck', 'pretty easy rehash grade 12 chemistry', 'go every single lecture write it all down all it', 'honestly this course isnt that bad this is coming someone who absolutely hated sch4u grade 12 i actually felt like this course was interesting i would say theres lot building things you learned grade 12 plus few new things but my opinion so long as you put work try not

help since they know this time is tough you so reach out help if you need someone help explain things bit you', 'this class was definitely challenging but also very manageable textbook is life saver

entertaining if youre taking course online', 'i took this course online taught by all 3 profs hopkins ingram tsen they all have different approaches when teaching this course it is just matter adjusting their teaching style overall easy course with small expansion sch 3u high school do not make mistake i did think that reading course notes doing assignments participation challenges are enough especially if chem is weaker subject do textbook questions buy textbook it will help you lot fact lot questions midterms were either similar or exactly same as questions textbook furthermore take advantage piazza website you can get answers other students or instructors matter minutes', 'course is absolutely unorganized fo people who dont have strong chem background this might be scary

did this course change my opinion i had prof tsen he was very good at teaching material i did find that hard material he didnt dumb it down which i sometimes need so i found watching dr ingrams vids

fall 2019 as someone who regularly went class i did not find this course too difficult some concepts overlapped high school while others were new but still relatively simple course notes were

was done class were great use later study guides tutorials were also useful study tools i also recommend doing participation quizzes they are very simple allow you get participation marks all

questions genuinely cares about how her students do final was also very fair 60 mc questions know your stuff you can easily pull 90s course', 'course is very well structured organized course notes are extremely comprehensive however you will struggle if youve never done high school chemistry before as it does assume is pretty generous amount previous knowledge its all multiple choice but this might

designed ensure that students do their best this course can be seen through various questions provided multiple assignments online quizzes clicker questions done throughout course before each midterm final exam make sure do practice sample midterm final exam questions provided learn as they are very similar like 95 ones midterms there are also various ways get help when you do not understand certain material profs this course also have review sessions before finals its good idea attend them because they will go over questions its good opportunity clarify things you dont understand they

be little annoying but they were both very fair content itself can be little hard grasp at time but with practice you will understand theres also ton practice problems available course notes online assignments make sure do practice problems especially ones sample midterm really understand them because they are often times very similar ones found midterms profs this course will often do review sessions before midterms finals its good idea attend them because they will go over questions its good opportunity clarify things you dont understand they also all record their lectures which is very nice there is also quite bit grade 12 review if youre thinking about being keener buying textbook dont save yourself money buy something else i bought it barely opened it because we already had so

participation is 5 your mark lekins class you could choose either participate clicker question sessions every friday or do online participation quizzes online she typically would post video night before fridays lecture make it very interactive lecture which was nice way learn online assignments are 10 your mark which you can opt out have weight them transferred your final exam however they closely resemble lot midterm questions enhance your understanding so i would recommend you just do them you get 4 attempts if you get above 80 they count it as 100 easy way earn 10 your grade first midterm was worth 12 people typically tend do worse because module 0 isnt covered as heavily class is review second midterm is 18 was significantly easier i was one mark away perfect but is much more

like that assignments were all problem solving they were often seemingly tough scary but working through them slowly with lots help office hours was where most learning happened me contrast i had friend different university whose algorithms course was testing how well you remember stuff lectures most assessments were mcq whats algo class where you dont have write lots algos prove correctness sure its easier but my friend said he would have preferred format here exam was quite doable if you understood material fairly well questions tested understanding major algorithm design strategies reductions not lot memorization needed if you did all assignments or read understood answers that said there was one question worth 5 50 points that asked us use algorithms know their runtimes given

course since i understood theory understood what was asked do assignments but simply didnt understand how implement these things into my program i found that during first half course there were not enough examples how use some functions your program but it became much better second half course even though content became much more difficult i failed 4 assignments but managed get 54 average all assignments final exam took me nearly 15 hours code but i managed do every question my advice this course is go office hours esp 1 1 if youre like me are afraid ask questions front others these office

'took this winter 2022 this was my second attempt at course i passed course was fair well organized there were weekly tutorials that we work as group weekly tutorial meeting present our solutions that helped enforce my understanding course material top assignments there were 2 tough assignments but i found rest be fair excellent at helping me understand course materials midterm average was low around 57 but i found it be very fair there were no tricky or any very unfamiliar questions at all exam was also very fair none questions asked were too tough or tricky except maybe one i really appreciate how course was run this term i found enumeration bit easier than graph theory mainly because i just suck at proof although i only found last chapter matching first few sections related path connectedness be tough find proof bijective proofs enumeration were tough but its not too bad some people found this course very interesting loved it some did not like it at all im kind between i found it nice learn something very different what im used linear alg calc i believe graph theory is very useful cs but like one other commenters said i also found it tough stay focused put work study course with not much applications if math 239 is not required course your degree you are considering whether take this or not i say give it try first week jumps right into bijective proofs so you get taste how tough it is right away compare this first time i took course spring 2021 huge difference i hated spring 2021 offering i wont go into details about why but you can scroll down see reviews people wrote that offering reddit too but tldr profs spring 2021 did not bother going piazza helping students tests were difficult as hell 1 hour 3 very tough questions i dropped before day test 3 but first 2 tests were rough assignments were biweekly instead weekly like winter 2022 so some course contents werent even covered assignments but tests instead they were tough as hell spring 2021 offering math 239 made me hate course but winter 2022 changed my mind everything was done so well winter 2022', 'this is tough course i personally found enumeration half be easier but it was much less

applications hopefully cs341 will provide me with those applications', 'didnt understand single thing first half course graph theory was much better but overall useless course math major', 'first math course i actually enjoyed midterm is brutal but final is bit more manageable', 'prereq cs341 its hard but good if you do pure math', 'first half was counting which many people dont like find hard do be quite frank it involved ton creativity get bijections but i did not personally find it all that hard just relax yourself take your time give yourself time answer questions as they will take some time graph theory portion was more interesting was fun though it too got more difficult at end you may need set significant time aside assignments get this done', 'this course was not easy was it interesting i think it depends person i can see how you might find this interesting although it wasnt particularly interesting myself if youre taking this course online prepare yourself study harder than you normally do youll thank me later', 'took it blended fall 2021 online course with person tutorials questions piazza were answered reasonably quickly i personally found tutorials most helpful resource course enumeration portion i found very challenging exam was difficult 60 average however graph theory was easier i liked it lot more overall not easy course but manageable if you practice ask questions', 'fairly challenging course with interesting concepts personally enjoyed enumeration more than graph theory but majority graph theory is apparently easier took it blended fall 2021 was solid 1 day week kind course tutorial lectures groupwork weekly assignment easily doable 10 12 hours enumeration exam was pre difficult our class avg ended up 60', 'graph theory was fun i think i am going take co 342 third year', 'was ran much better than spring counter part fall 2021 piazza was well populated content was laid out nice was easily understandable tutorial sessions were great

seemed be great previous offerings i dont know what happened spring 2021 re used lecture videos timed tests that were nothing like practice problems silence piazza half term marking was brutal

understand', 'just disclaimer i took this course spring 2021 with ashwin nayak chelweon heo olya mandelshtam jorn van der pol pray you never have go through what my term mates i had this was easily by far absolute worst course i have ever taken at waterloo with worst professors i ever had displeasure interacting with words arrogant cold ignorant come mind when i recall interacting with professors most basic help during office hours which were only time we could contact these people as they abandoned piazza first half course only returning once half class failed their test which was essentially midterm steroids 1 hour three very difficult questions unlike anything wed ever seen lectures which they didnt make course notes not them either assignments or practice problems terms difficulty style extremely harsh marking with absolutely no mercy we were all basically teaching ourselves this entire course which regular term is difficult enough only be thrown curve balls at every opportunity by professors teaching staff never have i felt such passionate disdain such course waterloo or school general ive had previous anxiety problems resurface because gross negligence professors who taught this course do avoid them at all costs tldr arrogant neglectful professors have teach yourself entire course pre recorded barebones lectures insanely hard tests with terrible marking distributions extremely harsh marking very very bad time spring 2021', 'craziest course ever i had never been able understand any piece knowledge since unit 1 i havent found how those things are helpful yet', 'this was my last straw literally no prof instructor help uncooperative staff no prof piazza literally our own pre recorded lecs hard af questions no curving even though most people are failing i took this course my 2a but pal who took it 4b failed this course so yeah have fun', 'no instructors or profs til 2 3rd way course lol cant believe i paid 1000 bucks this what joke', 'hard course that was useless cs students hopefully it gets better person since online lectures were useless solving assignments exams', 'i dont know what was going this term until halfway across term professors werent piazza format course seems have been reworked completely previous online offerings no good reason since previous offerings were apparently great there were lot more timed tests presumably stop cheating but i would guess it would help cheaters who were able get question paper beforehand because if you had seen questions before super strict time limits might seem lot more reasonable even profs had trouble solving practice problems office hours lectures were all old reused previous terms which were great i really enjoyed content but assessments especially timed exams were so stressful draining that i came away disliking course despite being interested topics', 'good course poorly organized i feel like each term they somehow make it worse with format i felt like first part enumeration while interesting did not go deep enough graph theory was really cool too this term they decided they werent going monitor piazza at all until about 2 3 way through term when they finally changed their mind tests are hard but not as bad as ppl say everyone just likes whine about how hard it is but difficulty is reasonable', 'very difficult course online offering this course consists watching prerecorded lectures which my opinion were high quality concise however these videos course notes are only materials you can learn practice problems do not come with solutions only tutorial problems have solutions instructors do not answer questions piazza instead they host office hours where you can ask your questions make sure go these office hours early week not night before assignment is due assignments were difficult due inconsistent marking schemes poor communication instructors this is caused by very limited communication between instructors students since instructors seem communicate only through office hours private e mails course also has three midterms or tests as they call it these tests aim assess students knowledge previous 3 or 4 weeks content many students including myself found time limit 60 minutes 20 minutes uploading be not enough these types questions tldr learn through pre recorded lectures high quality concise course notes if you want read them

because this course is quite difficult overall', 'no instructors piazza at all', 'i truly loved course thanks this course i learned spirit math art solving difficult problems course is definitely most challenging math course you will ever take by time you take this course i e 2nd year although it is recommended take this during 2b with stats knowledge you learned 2a i went with this course straight away 2a i would say knowledge stats would have helped me very beginning enumeration but really it aint that much so do not worry if you are taking it 2a now course content super interesting enumeration part was very challenging very rewarding as well i especially loved bijection strings ambiguity parts i found problems be very challenging at first but you will find yourself slowly building intuitions which was super rewarding i personally found exams 3 exams total be very straightforward compared assignments assignment average marks are around 70 90 enumeration 40 60 graph theory i wouldnt graph theory isnt any easier than other but it sure is interesting questions can be kinda predictable once you practice good chunk it overall super fun super difficult', 'loved it

bit difficult me at beginning but graph theory second half seemed be easier most people this course', 'easy fun course i found graph theory part little rote boring compared enumeration but it was also easier', 'this course was interesting but aint that easy you really have understand every point every concept you just cant avoid extra problems just because they are extras learn solve problems your own with least professors help they dont make midterms exams easy hence get less involved during that term', 'super interesting course with tons new concepts assignments exams were hard though even with online term be ready spend lots time this course exams were made randomly chosen questions with each exam focusing 1 3 material as grading best 2 out following 3 10 assignments throughout term

still pretty difficult overall interesting content but took bit fully absorb proofs rewire my brain be able come up with proofs go class take notes midterm final were lot easier than assignments',

difficult this is defiantly borderline math course as 95 course revolves around proofs personally i dislike most contents taught this course turing machine part is bit more interesting but assignment

require more effort understand', 'course itself was fairly easy although difficult at times it really builds high school knowledge most part but there is new content it says textbook is required but its only really build your understanding i strongly recommend it as i relied it completely i think part what made course little difficult was professor maybe its because its online which is 100 understandable but lot content could have gone more depth i feel like she may have explained things vaguely at times but then asked specifics term tests there were also kritiks which i actually found extremely useful i got fair markers who provided constructive feedback which i found helpful', 'course content was easy but disconnected i hate question type b b c worksheets had no answer key which completely defeats their purpose kritik assignments were useless people where cheating system by giving really high scores comments that boost other students ego tas quality is very questionable got very simple concepts wrong would search up answer internet insist that their answer is correct without being able explain why would not recommend this course', 'this course was so boring taught so poorly that i literally changed majors lost all interest subject biology', 'very easy course imo really builds grade 12 biology professor is really helpful', 'course was alright passed with b there are 4 tests 15 20 15 25 4 kritik assignments which are super easy marks each kritik assignment worth 6 there are weekly quizzes total quizzes are 5 your overall grade tests are most important part

prepared any type question that could occur test study hard focus well youll be able do well this class', 'this course is difficult no doubt about it having it online made it easier though do not try

here say buy it if you take notes what engelhardt is actually saying her screencasts youll be prepared tests will do fine notes slides alone are not enough as they arent very detailed her multiple

better', 'took it with heidi engelhardt online very interesting course i didnt care much biology high school but i found this course changed that most units are review high school but just much more depth though i do have say that i couldnt stand multiple choice questions that had choices like b or c because it would make me doubt myself lol engelhardt can also be hard get used but youll be fine end i do appreciate how passionate she is about biology fyi textbook is helpful but is not absolutely necessary despite it being required', 'i loved biology high school but hated this course with

had no idea what she was saying half time just read your notes youll be fine', 'make sure you understand concepts as they are taught because course keeps building them', 'despite that ive heard about

school course every unit has set lectures few mtuners that acted as graded active recall quizzes then semi cumulative test core concept assignments definitely helped with my understanding got me see if i lacked knowledge somewhere but with good time management these were not bother me grades these assignments part came your peers as they reviewed you some can be unfair but profs built system that allowed them be reviewed over rid i mostly studied tests day before did well tests were all multiple choice but don t be fooled there are many many trick options such as b c or b etc that are very tempting engelhardt s lectures had lot holes so be sure go over textbook help with tests overall relatively easy course easy 80 with work put into it i also had holyoak his lectures content were great

exams were multiple choice you would think thats easy right sometimes it was but most time questions involved 3 options other options were c b c professor engalheardt really knows how make multiple choice question feel like short answer question because you will need explain question yourself thoroughly order arrive at answer half this course was grade 12 bio other half was expansion grade 12 adding more detail concepts taught high school make sure you are able explain each concept required amount detail by yourself without aid notes or textbooks other words dont scroll through your notes

you try test questions are very tricky though tips studying make good notes make unit summary sheets use active recall re do mtuners look at old test mistakes ask yourself why it was wrong asking friend is good idea sleep enough before tests lol call friends study sessions exam was doozy tbh content very different course except unit 8', 'i really hated this course but its prerequisite bunch future biol courses so its recommended that you take it tests are very very application based so way you studied bio high school what i did was memorizing bunch keywords just going into test probably wont work this course i had dr engelhardt dr holyoak but be honest i didnt feel like either one them could explain content well maybe my experience would have been different had i been campus but this course i would recommend u take things into your own hands just teach yourself all material through mindmaps quizzing yourself reading textbook', 'i took this course online fall 2020 with holyoak engelhardt unlike most reviews here i found engelhardt be better than holyoak she actually put effort into her slides made new lecture videos holyoak other hand used lecture recordings previous years no pointer tools powerpoint were used hence made it hard follow along with diagrams both their slides have primarily images do well you have listen lectures especially if you do not want buy textbook personally textbook was useful me profs referred specific figure numbers images textbook hence reading captions under those images textbook were useful when re writing summary notes each unit do worksheets posted learn before tests as well as practice problems at end textbook chapters good luck', 'much more clear interesting when not taught by heidi engelhardt she spoke too fast used complicated words that were not even legible her slides had no words if you were unable hear word she said class which was fairly common with way she spoke you would not understand what was even going

about questions all all above or only c make you insane', 'i am first year biology student who took this course fall 2019 with todd holyoak heidi engelhardt i truly enjoyed this course as it covered some topics that i am interested pursuing content was always very interesting my opinion was usually easy although there were some challenging concepts there was decent amount overlap high school biology mostly grade 12 while textbook isnt essential i would highly recommend it as i personally used it lot lectures sometimes concepts are not fully explained which can result lot confusion i found that textbook i bought 4th edition used followed course almost directly was very helpful when rewriting going through notes midterms were both fair as well as online quizzes final exam was tough but if you understand concepts well you will do just fine there is lot information this course so be sure give yourself lot time prepare tests', 'took this course as elective i really enjoyed it i didnt really have much science background high school either but they taught course really well there is very little if anything you need clarify beyond lecture notes that being said make sure take good

different style teaching that takes little getting used lot metaphors comparisons lol there were 2 midterms final questions were tricky you will get so sick answers like b b none above that will cause you question your sanity make sure you know content but dont second guess yourself too much either there quite few diagrams lecture notes sometimes they can be hard understand if theres no description

put everyone same playing field its bit tricky if you didnt take bio high school but as long as you keep up with studying go lecture you should be fine tutorial is pretty pointless but its easy marks

could get ahead if you wanted we had 3 short speeches 3 longer speeches written quizzes ensure you had done readings or watched videos then written assignments based off group discussions i would not

it half credit i saw him only once irl but he was very personable guy as you might expect public speaking instructor content pretty boring i couldnt bring myself do readings until day before all my quizzes were due another thing quizzes are supposed be done weekly but they are all due at end semester so you can just put them off til then assignments are supposed be useful they are actually not bad online course probably better than alternatives spcom 100 or engl 109 but they are still pretty tedious do i dont think i really got better at public speaking as result grading easy peasy you can expect get 85 all your major assignments which are worth around 50 your mark as long as you actually put legitimate effort into them rest course is completion marks youll get 100 if you werent dumbass like me you actually submit your work time so basically you get 90 total as long as you actually finish your work', 'spcom 223 with jeff stacey is best course i have taken it has no assignments no

not valuable teach students how speak well if they cant speak eloquently about politics or social issues its irresponsible be apolitical this day age course consisted weekly discussions about assigned

accents etc english are valid yet we are marked how grammatically correct our writing is how clear our speaking is we watched ted talk why english requirements university students is barrier yet spcom

videos ourselves which worked really nicely i think this course is highly dependent instructor get stacey if you can', 'i didnt prepare any my speeches still did pretty well', 'readings were somewhat

has three big speech projects where most your marks come some these are groups three smaller minute long practice speech exercises this course is clearly good at what it sets out do i saw classmates go 4 minutes over time rambling speeches at start term concise point speeches with clear purpose by end term would absolutely recommend this course if youre looking get better at speeches because you will dont skip any lectures though class participation is usually big part lectures being part audience is important when others are making speeches also keep top required readings you dont want be clueless when your professor asks your thoughts article you were supposed have read', 'jeff stacey', 'bruh you gotta take this course face your fears public speaking let this class help you build

my prof it was easy get 75 but hard get above 85 overall not too work intensive', 'good course really depends your prof i had shira schwartz who was good but bit hard marker at first dont honestly think this course is super easy like easy 90 because its not public speaking they make you learn practice is not same as doing presentations etc goal is make you good at speaking improv way even memorizing your entire speech wont do it you since they want your speech seem really natural as if you havent memorized or rehearsed it lot but as if you are actually talking person audience or sharing your opinion that would be mindset i recommend going into this course with overall course not too bad although idk why we have make video assignment could have gone without all that trouble note no exam most 3 speech assignments plus weekly readings viewings are throughout course you literally have write 2 4 minute speech every few weeks which takes up lot time other course work tbh',

speeches', 'took it with kevin carey it was engaging course as classes were mostly discussion based readings early were bit dry but as course progressed assigned readings videos became more

speeches course', 'not lot work improved some skills overall okay course', 'was really easy do marks are very lenient fun doesnt take too much time other than making couple speeches outlines', 'best course 1a', 'fun gg', 'fun course', 'i took this course with greg it was blast all people my class were upper years they all had their own experiences share even though i am weak at public speaking i had tonnes fun course would recommend it anyone thinking completing their language requirement or just fun', 'this course teaches you how speak public by giving you lots practice class sizes are small

get i had jeff stacey he is fantastic not much work was required this course it was fun very practical', 'fun course teaches you speak better do other stuff good too felt like high school was definitely course i laughed most very fun meet other people joke around great elective', 'i was very scared public speaking before i took this course but this course gave me chance practice public speaking front very friendly positive audience 30 or so students best way be better public speaker get over fear is actually do it i definitely feel more comfortable front public audience now grading

75 but extremely difficult if not impossible get 90 at least with my prof', 'i had anders bergstrom short readings that i just bullshitted my weekly assignments he just marked it participation also

never actually did anything with any readings so i didnt bother', 'fun class if taken with right prof', 'lower marks than i expected tough marking this class was very enjoyable loved units

pretty easy 80 somewhat uninteresting', 'good course practice speeches there is some theory research needed but it is overall fun useful course', 'i think this would be really great elective if i didnt have it at 8 30 am course was easy you really dont learn any content its really just playground where you can practice your public speaking front others i think anyone who is half decent public speaking should take this course', 'recent restructuring this course include topics justice has taken significant portion course time actual public speaking skills spent way too much time readings

theoretical almost continuation high school english i wish there were more actual public speaking rather than boring group class discussions random essays', 'by easy i dont mean its necessarily easy get marks its just easy class chill i didnt like it too much there are lot assigned readings we didnt do nearly as many speeches as i had wished i guess it can train your speaking skills but lot class is just discussion readings', 'not course it used be as warning still great course', 'pretty useful course i had no confidence public speaking when i started this course with bit shoving my professor

painful sit through', 'probably one best courses ive ever taken very useful', 'first class is always intimidating but people you work with soon become like family i have learnt very useful public

bad once you wrapped your head around it i found content kind dry though', 'this course sparked my interest taking further stat courses main focus course was constructing confidence intervals

concepts then itll easy apply them assignments tests', 'i know lot people hated this course but i actually found it pretty interesting first half is kind boring since theyre just introducing you all concepts youll need second half taking this spring 2022 there were 3 term tests 4 assignments final exam term tests were all pretty straightforward if you did recommended practice questions course

reading than listening i wish profs have lecture videos available top course notes like math 239 assignments were quite tedious but fun do if you had good habit finishing course note finishing assignments over few days you should be fine if you are like me leave everything until day before due date then you will have horrible time try your best at least read assignments as soon as they release course content i really did not enjoy section formal language parsing i know they are essential building compilers but i did not find them interesting i yawned every 5 minutes reading notes those sections all other contents were interesting though context sensitive analysis determine things like valid type no duplicate variable names code generation linker loaders memory management were all very interesting uwflow ratings this course are high with majority liking it saying its great but dont set your expectation too high i went thinking i would like this more than cs 136 cs 246 but i was wrong i still like it though but its not that great me', 'delivery was 100 read textbook your own textbook wasnt even that well written personally flipped classroom model was complete failure me

really done good job killing my interest', 'i found this course interesting process building working compiler was rewarding course itself isnt too hard but it can be very time consuming as assignments

took this lab online with sue stathopulos i would say that this was my favourite lab i took so far its well organized engaging she makes sure that students are well prepared lab reports by having you

seems have been adapted very well online learning platform since most content was very well organized learn sue stathopulos is amazing ive had great ta so far lab test was only thing that brought my

was quite bit time invested writing out procedure doing pre lab quizzes course consisted five labs each with pre lab quiz be completed 24 hours ahead scheduled lab session writing out procedure lab before starting experiment lab report only one lab reports was formal which took about dozen hours finish it was not too bad although i do not recommend pulling off all nighter finish it like i did

pretty fair though tas sometimes graded weirdly', 'this is probably best math class that i have experienced online so far you can tell effort was put create it that it wasnt something just thrown together like some math classes seemed be their online version course is very well setup theres lot your turns where you can do practise questions based examples modules which really help with your

side which was big help this course is first math course i have taken so far where i actually feel like i am learning something only thing i recommend is adding few more example videos near end course

school first 2 3 this class is review', 'most disorganized class ive ever taken d content is easy but marking assignments was harsh had very unclear requirements', 'evil course go lectures do every assignment every extra thing because exam will drop you just survive this course if youre honours science biology do not take it even if they recommend it dont profs were great wanted help us as much as they could', 'completed this during covid 19 remote learning this course is review grade 12 university physics until we arrived at rotational mechanics which is more involved but easy if you know how learn physics right way by yourself there was no exam remote learning as we just did worksheets homework group work with hard deadlines questions timed quizzes each week were tricky since they would not directly replicate problems that were solved lessons so you would really need understand concept not just memorize solutions questions this was easier said than done especially with university workload this is why you need make sure you understand grade 12 physics before taking this course i suggest that if you are comfortable with physics use calculus based textbook since its not difficult you can gain better insight into concepts through calculus rather than just algebra', 'ill be honest you need put 3 5 hours work week hour which is groupwork if you put that work youre set 97 average however make sure your randomly chosen group likes you because 15 your course mark is given by your 3 groups groups rotate so you get new one each month there are weekly quizzes homework worksheets completion only answers given so just copy none it is hard its not really useful course but definitely easiest pure science credit get brenda lee is amazing prof will literally go out her way help you catch her discord yes shes that cool she really is one best profs ive ever had', 'very easy if you took high school physics', 'if you dont need physics or wont put lot effort learn this content just dont take class', 'if you took grade 11 physics you should ace this course it was basically complete repeat with exception learning rotational kinematics last week class however this class will be difficult if youve never taken physics before', 'dr lee was incredibly helpful during her lectures really cared about each every student she was concise clear was extremely patient with students she often did examples class which are very helpful doing well assignments quizzes exams she led study sessions both midterm exam examples that were close actual evaluation if you take this course you need take it with her this course isnt hard do well i would really advise doing optional components as it takes huge weight off final exam which was harder than most evaluations', 'this class is pretty easy overall too bad it is probably worst run class science faculty lot overlap high school physics very unorganized course youll have teach yourself most topics as class profs will go over just few examples then leave rest groupwork this class is made so much more difficult than it has be you are forced do things way they want you do them which was difficult me as high school my physics teacher encouraged us stick with whatever works best us sum up this is class that should not cause you too much trouble but due way it is run it may brenda lee was great prof too bad sanderson is charge', 'worst course my freshman 1a term they structured this course so weirdly that you dont actually learn anything during lecture youre expected do it only your own you just do individual group worksheets instead do not take this course with prof sanderson he mumbles into mic very quietly so i couldnt understand him half time is very intimidating ask questions i have asked him some questions after class he just made me feel like idiot other hand dr hill covered our class once i understood everything that day because he actually teaches i asked him question after class he made sure i actually understood concepts that question was asking only reason i didnt drop this course was because its required as biomedical science student i couldnt switch into dr hills class time deadline', 'i am first year biology student who took this course fall 2019 i personally was not fan this course i took both grade 11 12 physics so i was relatively confident my abilities especially since there was lot overlap however teaching methods that were used were not helpful anyone who was new learning material methods which they taught were confusing sometimes even incorrect each hour half class profs tried cram lesson clicker questions individual assignment group assignment it was too much everything was always rushed confusing students assignments could also be very confusing there were often mistakes them quizzes ranged difficulty extremely easy near impossible solve midterms were difficult compared assignments but were relatively okay exam was much harder i was okay with most it due fact that i had my grade 12 but i know that many students heavily struggled especially those with little previous physics knowledge course was also very unclear unorganized constantly i was disappointed by it', 'i know many people who havent taken physics high school really struggle this course even though it is introductory course perspective someone who did take physics grade 11 12 course still wasnt easy even covering concepts done high school course was very disorganized professor sanderson himself is disorganized not engaging this made learning difficult lectures were used primarily class worksheets group work you did most learning pre class assignments midterms were both difficult second one especially as average was 55 final was worth anywhere between 40 80 but you wouldnt know how much it would be sure nor weight any other component course because everything depended how well you do final something good note before going into midterm final is that mc questions are not worth 1 mark each as they normally would be any sane course but instead worth like 6 marks so you would lose lot marks each wrong multiple choice question', 'lectures are slow course is filled with badly organized group work prof sucks at grammar half questions pre class assignments make no sense i dont go class or tutorials as they are extremely boring participation marks are optional recommended textbook isnt even real textbook its just website written by some dude his free time only questions study off are ones we do class terrible course hopefully future courses are better organized', 'most unorganized course i have ever taken exam gets curved though', 'fk this course', 'lectures not too hard but hard midterm brutal exam stay top material do practice

you ass', 'i thought i was ok at physics until i took this course it also didnt help that lecture hall i was had super comfy chairs so i was verge falling asleep most time i had prof hawthorn who seems like nice guy my only complaint was that his writing board was pretty messy little hard follow he also did clickers which provided very much needed 5 participation marks i know that other sections who didnt have him as prof did not do clickers so 5 was weighted elsewhere average midterm was low be warned that lot questions you will get are very application based final consisted about 8 or 10 cant remember long answer questions each out 20 marks even if you dont understand question try do something get some part marks also im pretty sure final was curved because it was tricky online quizzes worth 20 were also pretty annoying since they were only out 3 so if you get 2 wrong you got 33 if youre like me you arent that good at physics my tip getting good mark is try your absolute best scrape as many marks as you can go tutorials get participation marks there too', 'hated this course prof was unclear lectures wrote messy notes board his online notes were even worse quizzes are out 3 so getting one question wrong automatically drops you 66 which adds up quickly tas tutorials were awful huge waste time so i stopped going decided have weight transfer final midterm was fairly difficult with low average 58 which was only worth 10 15 final was absolutely insane i probably got around 30 exam which was worth 70 final grade somehow finished with 60 only good thing about this class is curve', 'this class was very similar high school physics only introducing new concepts at end course make sure do lots practice get help early when you dont get stuff you cant just go lecture

so that way you get weight shifted off your final participation marks there was one midterm it was not too bad i did not study at all midterm still made it out with decent mark 79 final had some

is she posts her lectures so you can go back watch them', 'as someone who hadnt taken any bio courses highschool molecular biology section this course kinda had me lost aside that mendelian genetics

classes i had taken online first year winter 21 only downside class was amount lectures but i was very motivated this class so i finished either half or all sunday before week began content was interesting intriguing as long as you paid attention understood weekly quizzes due friday were extremely easy assignments were also fun easy i especially liked drosophila assignment lac operon assignment was straight forward easy as well everything was amazing apart final exam i had amazing grades but got around 60 exam it caught lot students off guard especially because it focused concept

biol 130 if youve taken that as christine doesnt try as hard trick you multiple choice as heidi did 130 ex there are very rarely b or c options because christine doesnt say things not slideshows which

all year', 'this is interesting course is not too bad there are weekly tutorials with mandatory attendance but were never too burdensome midterm was fair was easy thanks practice midterm dr dupont

she seems', 'less memorizing than biol 130 but those mitosis meiosis units can drive you crazy mandatory tutorials they check attendance assign group work assignments', 'this course was actually lot

was perfect i wouldnt recommend taking this course if youre hoping it will be easy mark booster but its not bad', 'not as birdy as i thought it would be but pretty low maintenance course did not like

my friends who were very picky overall this lab course really did teach me how properly write lab report formal one content itself is very easy i would say one lab reports was very tedious as it took

being taught very little practical lab information was taught labs focused only theory which was mostly high school this did not feel like lab class at all it was lot work stressful first formal lab

one which i think is very poor excuse not making their expectations requirements both small big details clear us there was often experiments that didnt work out well yet we were expected get correct answers given wrong or often nonexistent information there were no lab videos just written procedure pictures results which resulted bad online lab experience i feel like i missed out lot important lab experience knowledge', 'this course was kind lacking heard absolutely nothing professor entire term many us had tas that were useless or were rude gave no constructive feedback information we learned was or would have been useful but it was online so take that with grain salt', 'this course was legitimate roller coaster stress this is my own fault but i left first lab activity until day freaked out over amount work that had be done about month after i finished that activity after i had handed 3 extra assignments i got first lab activity back my ta docked marks stuff i didnt know i needed include because it wasnt rubric about half way through i honestly considered dropping it but im glad i didnt because after first couple assignments it gets so much less stressful i almost bombed first lab report but got almost perfect second one so i cant complain too much after i got my first lab back i found out i got reported dean academic offence because i didnt cite something properly then i found out tas went crazy with reporting almost half class thought they were gonna get kicked out school unnecessary stress honestly most stuff isnt clear terms rubric but experiment

directly answer some', 'like high school but more serious dont be afraid email your tas dont feel bad bothering them because its little details that really help lab reports', 'informal labs are very easy 90s formal labs are extremely hard at least me whos not good at labs interesting concepts bit tedious read through all procedures they didnt give us enough background understand results so you need email tas', 'communication this course was very poor example different tas would give their students very different expectations this was big deal one reports where some students were given expectation that they must add specific thing their lab reports others were left with information that said explicitly not do that very same thing this resulted many students losing over 10 their grade that assignment despite it not being our fault honestly if communication had have been better course would have been substantially better', 'this course barely has anything do with biol 130 lol

catastrophic due lack communication between tas instructor between tas themselves timing issues instance we had 3 weeks just do intro assignment worth 1 as well as our whmis aiqs not needed this resulted 7 weeks rushed lab reports 1 per week when 3 weeks beginning semester could have allowed students complete formal lab reports with some more time especially considering they were worth 10 20

just not suited online learning', 'failed everyone first lab', 'i hated every bit it yet i got 95 idk how', 'easiest lab ever very useful youll love it be careful about tas though my ta took off 50 my

shouldve listened overall it was really fun though', 'honestly highhhhhly dependant your tas i got blessed with knowledgeable easy markers so i ended this course with 95 but i know friends other

this course fall 2019 i thought that lab was useful as we were given hands experience many laboratory techniques i also thought that writing formal lab reports was great experience however they were

time ensure that you do your best is weighted accordingly 15 first one 20 second one there are no final exam this course many labs are designed so that you only need 1 hour class complete it at end

decided by one exam not 5 reports i spent hours working hard it didnt help that i bombed final even though every question seemed so simple so after performing so well whole semester end killed my mark

provide so many opportunities boost up your marks however her lab tests are brutal often times unfair we are expected be able answer 40 questions most which are calculation based around 80 minutes

be safe then sorry considering your lab report marks will carry you throughout course', 'my opinion is that this course is just chem120l part 2 literally sue set course up exact same way so if you did well chem120l youll likely get similar mark this course she makes lab tests exceptionally difficult as ive heard non covid years lab exams as well so try get as many marks as you can before that point

when compared various assignments course notes are great resource you are honestly good just reading course notes students were required do quiz before each lecture read course notes lectures were very interesting however oftentimes i found them not be needed as course notes already explained all concepts very well lectures are great getting some extra practice with proofs as all you really do

courses made me struggle remember what i learned as course kept progressing after lot review many things i started understand more more assignments were weekly but short concise with very very tedious

just linear algebra usual proofs', 'took course spring 2021 with anton mosunov its still my favourite math course date content builds math 136 which was already super interesting dr mosunovs lectures

little bit more difficult but still manageable online modules had lot concept checks which helped learn but also took quite while assignments were fair if you start early go office hours when you are stuck you shouldnt have problem 50 final paper is hard prepare but felt like fair exam', 'this course offers very interesting material provides basic foundation python which i believe is very useful skill i am not cs person so i wont lie i found this course challenging more than i found it easy concept checks start off easy but then get lot more complex due all string list methods we use assignments are like they were cs15 meaning they were three questions average however they can definitely be time consuming given if you have not learned python before or have even no experience coding this course isnt something you can just put aside bit do day before either you may be able get away with it at start but come module 4 up it gets more challenging my advice succeeding this course is actually go out buy python textbook so you can get some extra reading about things you will be learning course because me i didnt always find readings edx clear nor enough as well abuse office hours always go when youre stuck definitely try assignments early because doing design recipe python takes lot more time than racket is not something you want be starting at 1 am morning its due one main thing i liked however was that course is lot more organized set up than cs115 was', 'python', 'course content was super interesting really important but course delivery during covid was

taking 3 full days each complete while having entire unit which can take full day as well about 80 my time last term was spent this course however this being said content is not too bad but weeks 6 8 are hardest content where course really starts ramp up difficulty my biggest suggestion anybody taking this course online is utilize office hours try go office hours with profs because they know what they can cant say regarding assignments whereas tas will tell you really general unhelpful information most time', 'online format is horrible you essentially have teach yourself entire course it is

practice assignments link learn should be somewhere i ve forgotten click assignment each unit enter random numbers as answers v important you need answer every question then submit at end copy

didnt even understand what i was reading during first few modules had reread them over over again this course online during this winter 2021 term is complete waste time i dont regret single bit

difficult but teaching team provided one worst if not worst learning experiences i have ever taken part lectures zoom were disorganized ppts were missing grammer key figures any sort explanations it became so bad that i just had attend lecture find out what we were learning then turn youtube which is your best friend this course figure out how tutorials were complete garbage tas running them did

legendary their difficulty i personally found midterm be quite easy because i had solid grasp high school concepts had very good teacher grade twelve but majority people had lot trouble average was around 55 2015 final was more difficult because questions were same difficulty as midterm but were considerably longer because we had far less exposure possible problem types concepts like torque

midterm final over weekly quiz structure they had here concepts were kind all over place by end i was wondering how what we were learning even related back microbiology course kind tricks you sense that first 3 5 weeks are easy understand quizzes are not difficult but by end you have absolutely no idea what hell is going everybody says neufeld is awesome professor but there was literally no interaction with professor online because course consisted long boring readings no lecture videos so i dont even really know what his teaching style looks like i would recommend you probably take this course campus if you need want take it it is also useful me because now i know never take another microbio course again lol', 'neufeld is such amazing prof even online you can tell that he really

participation clicker questions are very representative questions he will ask midterm final both evaluations are extremely fair as he only tests you content he has covered class textbook is not required do well this course this course was breath fresh air after travesty that was biol 130 as midterm exam this course were very straightforward very few b c b c all above none above nonsense that was present biol 130 jdn is my hands down my favourite prof that ive ever had so far because he makes this rather dry course extremely interesting so much that i found myself often getting up attending early morning lectures he is extremely passionate about microbiology provides students with many different resources help them succeed recordings each lecture animations supplementary information topics covered class jdn was also very generous final exam that he removed 3 questions exam that he felt were too hard worded confusingly out 100 despite average below low 70 there was also bonus mark there are 10 topics total that are 50 80 slides each accompanied with notes that give you more insight as some concepts are hard understand if you only look at slides or dont attend

still easily achievable this course good luck', 'not useful because i didnt take any additional micro courses but neufeld was amazing prof must take it with him he makes class interesting engaging',

course was that its only one midterm 35 exam 65 with clicker taking 5 whichever you do worse so if you do poorly one its really easy tank your mark that said its definitely possible do very well if you stay top content throughout semester', 'josh neufeld its honestly hard talk about this course without mentioning him this reason i absolutely implore you take this course as lecture as opposed online this breathes lot life into otherwise dry material', 'course is very straightforward you dont really need go class if you want get 80 if you want that last 20 youre going need go class absorb

matter if you get it wrong or right just counts participation 35 midterm exam material test is 5 powerpoints 65 cumulative exam material tested is 10 powerpoints final exam is much easier than midterm overall 80 this course is very achievable personally i found it most helpful attend lecture just listen then rewatch videos take notes that since i could understand material at my own pace neufeld also uploads practice quizzes doesnt count towards grades help you review material each powerpoint these are somewhat helpful most questions come straight textbook you do not need purchase textbook

similar or even same as what you would see actual exams good luck', 'this was by far my favourite biology course date content is very interesting particularly those with interest exploring microbial world content is relatively straightforward particularly if youve taken cell biology or genetics prior this course mid term exam final exam were both very fair content came directly slides profs

passionate about his field i highly recommend taking course with him', 'this course was breeze would recommend taking as average booster if you have some background knowledge biology easily 80 above

study it my brain just couldnt comprehend boring material id wake up 1 hour later feeling as refreshed as ever power nap i dont remember taking there are some folks out there who are passionate about

will find that content itself is not that difficult however you can still spend lot time debugging it because there are some pitfalls uc if you dont pay attention some them are k known issues teaching team but not students also since uc is based c you know that debugging some issues can be very time consuming addition that you will spend lot time writing or debugging code that has absolutely nothing do with concurrency because assignments will always require you handle special inputs you should be very careful with this part because if your program doesnt handle all invalid inputs correctly you will probably fail assignment even though they say testing part does not worth much marking which is lie this makes me feel it is practical testing course if you dont need take this class not se then please dont take it after all what they teach this class will have little if any impact how you code future but i have admit i did enjoy it however if you ask me if i would have taken this course if i knew what it was like then i definitely would not take it', 'since no language implements all concurrency constructs taught course course is instead taught using uc custom version c that is absolute hell debug assignments also expect you implement argument parsing error checking provide extensive testing documentation therefore even though course is supposed teach concurrency 50 it ends up being uc trivia or programming debugging code unrelated actual course material', 'worst cs course ive taken at waterloo if you are cs then please choose literally any other 3rd 4th year cs course if you are se are forced take cs 343 then you have my condolences', 'i took this course thinking it would lead useful concepts real world applications little did i know that prof makes you learn his own made up language entirety course at one point he was teaching concept class bragged it only existed his language full coroutines half course content will leave you wondering why your time is being wasted learning this junk other half is covered cs 350 assignments are little long mostly extended by fact that large chunk your time will be dedicated trying decipher what he actually wants you do assignment outline piazza prof even tas are so intentionally obtuse condescending point where you wonder if they have bet going who can be worst if i hear this guy say automagically one more time im going lose my mind this is only course ive written uw flow review as its by far worst cs course ive taken undergrad so far if youre cs i wouldnt take this course if i were you if youre se id consider switching cs', 'i told my friend this course was going be useless he kept telling me itll get more interesting later it did not get any more interesting prof is good but content will never be used outside theoretical cs also grading is harsh youre often left wondering why you got something wrong very little feedback they take lots points off code style without giving you style guide', 'concepts arent that difficult but assignments can be particularly if youre not great with c familiarity with c can be difference between passing failing this course unfortunately', 'peter buhr is great prof but i think i wouldve gotten lot more out this course if it was taught without uc i do still recommend taking it as you do learn quite lot but i am quite disappointed i didnt come out learning anything industry standard', 'long assignments only spent 1 time thinking about concurrency rest time was spent debugging obscure micro c details course also spent great deal time discussing some less relevant parts concurrency at least terms how most people will use it thats fine all but its only useful ish pretty much everything was already covered operating systems course so basically this course only adds couple new concurrency styles ex actors goes deeper into locks', 'one best courses ive taken at uw', 'incredibly important course anyone doing concurrent programming tough as nails though with bugs being hell debug', 'one worst courses ive ever taken peter bhur is incredible lecturer but his concurrency methods are irrelevant most what you will learn this course is not used practice usually because they are too complicated incomprehensible but sometimes because its just not how people implemented it theres lot cool little facts youll learn course but most them are just little tidbits knowledge that you talk about with people impress them did you know c can handle most exceptions arent useful i honestly dont believe ive learned anything relevant about concurrency that i didnt know already assignments this course were worst assignments ive ever had about 70 80 time spent working them was spent building time wasting things like output generators or trying parse what assignment was even asking none assignment questions were hard they were just time consuming worst way there was also no opportunity creativity problem solving you were told exactly what do exactly how do it usually very confusing language any deviation would lose you marks marking assignments was insane you will have marks taken off things that arent wrong but buhr didnt do it that way so you lose marks you will lose marks putting code one perfectly reasonable place when buhr put it somewhere else you will lose marks formatting your code differently that buhr formats his code i submitted answer theoretical question once which you can come up with two different answers depending how your interpret problem submitted full proof i got 30 question because buhr got other answer they didnt say or explain why they thought my proof was wrong i was simply wrong because buhr did it another way we also need talk about micro c this is buhrs language that he designed concurrency but nobody uses except this course youll quickly learn there are very good reasons nobody uses language syntax is pretty bad there is essentially no documentation or help out there except documentation buhr has language also has its share errors bugs which buhr will most likely find throughout term i have counted 11 errors language that were solved by just remaking end i feel sad about this course concurrency is very interesting topic buhr is honestly best lecturer ive ever had if he took that passion applied it teaching useful things let someone else make mark assignments i could have really loved this course but as it stands i would strongly suggest you dont take this course unless you absolutely have youll learn more about concurrency trying build android app or making toy concurrent system that youll ever learn this course', 'best course ive taken at uw you learn ton useful material its extremely well laid out assignments are difficult but if you start them early its fine exams are very fair buhr will always give previous 2 offerings exams as samples study off do yourself favour take this course everything you do after cs350 is up you but you owe it yourself take this course', 'one most interesting courses i have taken at uw course uses extension c called uc which supports many types concurrency constructs although uc is not used outside this course there are tons important takeaways i feel like this course really helped me mature as programmer assignments can be challenge but are definitely worth effort', 'very involved course it has extremely interesting assignments that some people found easy others spent their whole life doing exams were mostly short answer multiple choice memorizing regurgitating slides which i did not like there were some interesting coding questions exams that went beyond assignments terms difficulty which i did like everyone liked buhr', 'one most organized courses ive taken at waterloo', 'this was pretty hard', 'lot most useful content this course is already taught os unfortunately lot this course is about minutia uc teaching language i understand why they use uc its only way they can teach that many concurrency structures one language what i dont like is how much time test questions they spend minutia terminology uc also many structure taught arent relevant outside uc maybe ada theres some useful material this course but lot it isnt that useful or interesting', 'assignments are difficult time consuming but exams were very fair lots useful interesting content this course', 'concurrency side this course is useful its own but as side effect you will learn advanced control flow likely come out this much better c programmer this is one

teaches lot about concurrent programming also related topics such as control structure programming languages how exceptions are executed hardware optimizations concurrency etc there were 6 long assignments taking much your time but they were all very interesting negatives test documentations were super tedious half exam content was memorizing facts notes', 'i have disagree with reviews complaining about use c this course it is easier understand is more comprehensive than other languages or libraries which are presented lectures it also has helpful extensive documentation course is excellently organized very interesting teaches general principles that are applicable any concurrency paradigm', 'content is somewhat interesting it at least opens your mind up some new paradigms emphasis really odd code style outdenting etc is bit unfortunate it wouldve been slightly more useful if practical language was used instead pedagogical one uc', 'interesting course thought itd just be reviewing basic concepts but they go depth how concurrency is actually implemented at low level issues that can arise assignments take lot time but they were fun biggest negative is uc youll lose serious marks if you dont memorize syntax peculiarities this toy language that literally nobody uses real work', 'while most theory taught this course is useful large amount time is devoted c extension c that appears have no users outside waterloo memorizing api that you will never use again is waste time this course could easily be taught with standard languages would be much improved', 'brought lot new light concurrent programming that i thought i was good at before', 'interesting useful course but definitely not easy make sure leave yourself enough time do assignments', 'struggled quite bit with this course debugging was hard assignments were challenging too not mention uc has no resource outside waterloo my knowledge but teaches you about very interesting cs topics that everyone should really know', 'assignments are fun not too challenging', 'most interesting course cs program you will leard lot things if you thought you know lot about threading this course is likely change that perception first few weeks make sure take it only with peter buhr exams are really hard though assignments are long difficult debug but you learn interesting concepts course', 'make sure you pay attention class do all assignments also follow testing guidelines its really important test properly this course', 'most convoluted handling this topic ive ever seen concurrency is not difficult topic i found myself going google learn essentially every topic covered this course assignments are horribly worded point that reading assignment takes longer than doing them honestly 350

please skip this course unless you really like anatomy because it goes very depth into lot stuff leaves you confused i personally loved this course it was challenge but it was nice learning content did not mind i was up until 3am doing so here are some tip 1 course is not easy big reason is that its very textbook heavy i had vivian she uses lot info textbook into test final as well as lot application questions i highly doubt anyone would pass this course without textbook luckily its free online 2 what i wish i had known was do homework questions provided textbook after every chapter before attempting her quizzes midterms tests she really does base her questions off them sometimes they are exact same questions i did them last minute before taking final not even kidding some them were exactly same again this is not only thing you should rely lot her questions are application based you really need grasp concept answer those 3 information this course can get overwhelming with number pages textbook read i recommend reading at least 6 7 pages after watching every individual lecture that way you do not cram 300 pages before midterm or final plus 20 your mark is doing assignments textbook so dividing your readings like this will really be useful that', 'took this course online i really enjoyed learning content i dont consider myself stellar at biology but i did find course overall was pretty fair terms marking tests i recommend finding quizlet flashcard sets terms cycles asap so you can practice early since there is lot content that is covered you dont necessarily need textbook or course notes pass but it can be helpful understanding concepts save time note taking', 'not useful me considering my specialization is biotech i focus more microorganisms but still lovely course take lots info take but if you were paying attention it lectures really did those mastering ap questions well youll be fine', 'definitely hard course but so interesting useful textbook course notes are expensive but mandatory so make sure you get them both before classes start final was extremely hard specific but you are given practice test so that helped make sure you put

incredibly content heavy i recommend course over online otherwise very interesting', 'i did this course online i found it extremely interesting i really like course material however since it was all

theyre still manageable', 'this class was really interesting but i found it really hard it requires lot reading textbook every single day if you get off track its hard get back it however pearson

you keep top it', 'quite possibly easiest course department biology free 10 assignments midterm was very fair final was notch harder but thats understandable since it covers so much materials course notes are excellent about 150 pages summarizing half textbook', 'this course made me want cry tears how much time i committed memorize vivians 150 page bible easy 90 if you want memorize her course notes read her textbook wanted puke misery when i memorized every single page those course notes very interesting however if you love human physiology', 'great class only complaint would be about quizzes at end every unit students must complete 15 question quiz 20 minutes they are manageable do well but rather stressful there are also optional assignments which are easy definite grade boosters

is interesting but vivian is such tricky exam writter it really makes you feel terrible she pulls info textbook never discussed class puts it exam she told us that final would be like 80 info after

with 70 although i did study 10 days straight exam hopes getting 50 it was torture because entire time i thought id fail course its not like i didnt try midterms because i did try i swear i did study this course just takes so much time effort if you dont understand something beginning course it just snowballs youre seriously screwed other hand content itself was interesting', 'loved class tophat is lifesaver go office hours early if you dont understand something but honestly did not put that much effort got 90', 'this course gets really bad rep i can see why it is lot work but you just need do practice questions i recommend doing questions practice tests redo questions course notes also hint get tophat do extra questions they often put questions extra questions onto midterms finals trend i noticed so if you do you can knock few questions out', 'honestly i enjoyed this course i am not gonna lie say it was never hard it was definitely hard keep up beginning since it was all this new material being thrown at you course progresses really fast so you really gotta stay top your stuff but midterms are really straight forward literally 0 tricks also they divide course at end depending what gives you highest grade', 'definitely need keep top material do lots study questions but not impossible get good mark', 'alright so people view organic chemistry as boogeyman science courses lot negativity is overhyped its really heavy course with pretty low average but midterms exams are very very fair dont feel overwhelmed give up trust that knowing understanding material will translate doing well it will make sure you do all practice midterms exams they provide without cheating youll know where you stand based these', 'people will scare you into thinking this is crazy difficult unmanageable course its not stay up date with material do practice dont fall behind not at start not middle not at end youll be fine do old term tests exams really great practice sometimes theyll reuse question here there please stay top things this course', 'i think problem lot people have with organic chemistry is simply lack studying practice first all it is possible do well however do well you really need understand what youre being taught you can go class absorb knowledge they give you but you really need practice practice practice it is easy say you understand something but all too many times do people think they know something when reality they dont hence reason 60 average midterms my biggest pieces advice this course are as follows 1 buy textbook tophat it provides online code interactive quiz like questions practice practice practice some more with those questions 2 buy more expensive model kit its something like 40 but wow does it come save day also understand how use model kit dont just willy nilly come into midterm thinking youll be able know how use it spend some time with it practice some questions making models with sticks balls 3 go office hours i had forsey he was charm made understand some concepts pretty easy by going him also emailing him or i am sure other coordinator is also very useful he is pretty fast responses i was never really good at chemistry high school or even 100 level chemistry courses most people take but i am expecting at least 90 after final however like forsey says class its memorization with understanding memorize few rules well there is definitely lot but it is manageable with decent amount practice you can get it down do well is organic chemistry easy no im not going sugar coat it however know you can do well it is possible it is manageable no one is going hand you free marks study hustle you can definitely expect results this feels like motivational speech or something lol best luck you can do it', 'ive always been bad at chemistry so difficulty this course me was not surprise course went much too quickly me keep up id come out lecture more confused than i was before they started used flipped classroom approach lecture where you do background reading before class then come into class do quick review lesson then jump straight into examples this method worked some students but i was not one them my one piece advice is read course notes keep up its so easy fall behind extremely difficult catch up', 'amazing course with amazing course notes final was fair exactly as expected not hard do well if you do enough practice even if you dont keep up during semester', 'top hat saves your life do those questions over over go lecture youll do fine if you do bad midterms dont drop course prof will do 100 final most likely gives you some time salvage your grade', 'dont understand outstanding negative association with this course you just have practice all reactions given tophat chapters practice questions are blessing', 'useful sense it preps you orgo 2 but honestly i thought it was easier than orgo 2 but you really have put effort thoroughly understand mechanism if you want avoid tricks exams', 'its not as hard as people tell you but it isnt easy definitely need stay top everything but once you get later course things start come together make lot sense', 'keep up with work you should be fine dont slack review before after each lectures', 'this was undoubtedly my favourite chemistry course so far dont fall behind youll ace mid terms final', 'this course is super easy gets little trickier at end but if you take good notes class definitely above 80 class midterms were very basic lot like practice midterms given just make sure do lots practice questions before exams you should be able ace it', 'l o l okkkkk lemme tell ya so if u just read notes youll fail but if you put time effort do all practice questions you can get good mark its not course where you can memorize everything you really need understand reactions', 'this was hard course required lot time effort i took it online during work term couldnt imagine taking it during regular term with 4 other courses definitely requires you focus solely it 70 final is bit intimidating but if you put time entire semester it will not be anything that is tricky or something you havent seen before if you put time read all tophat chapters thoroughly make notes these are more useful than online lecture modules you will do fine practice exams are very representative final', 'tons practice required', 'reviews i read here before taking course i got bit scared what expect i guess being bit scared motivated me keep up with material review it regularly course was surprisingly not that hard it just needed some effort

procrastinating study ahead time understand what mechanisms are overall 90 is easily achievable if you put effort pre read or you will fall behind because course does example questions class', 'super easy bad reputation this course is complete illusion people will say that you need stay top your work when that is not possible you can cram this course its not hard at all 90 is easily achievable if you just do practice finals midterms', 'pretty enjoyable course overall but you just got keep up with work if you have any shot passing', 'thank god i never have take that again', 'this course is great those with average above 90 or those who like adrenaline rushes heart attacks you experience every midterm is worth thrill all my friends myself received 50 60 each midterm you cant get any higher than that unless youre morn smart prof congratulates class 60 midterm average meaning that she thinks course is too easy everyones liking perhaps midterms must be made even harder ensure 50 average best way prepare this course is not be taking any other courses except this one as profs go so fast cover so much content one lecture that no one knows what is ever going most people are often 3 chapters behind at all times perhaps if you dedicated 100 your time this course you can get decent mark thus it is best take it summer when you have no other courses take up your time except this course is purposely only offered winter so that those who fail there is about 15 fail rate every year must take it again next fall cannot take chem 267 without it', 'if you read course notes before

we could expect always did what he said he would do i loved structure course textbook had ten chapters which fit perfectly into term allowing instruction one chapter per week we were then quizzed each

tan dinh found it very poorly organised dysfunctional you can take my review with grain salt because math physics are subjects i am awful at however some important points every review you see here about how your ta makes or breaks course it wasn not great time is correct if your ta doesnt care youve never done physics high school this course will be extremely hard require lot studying your free time especially if physics isnt something that comes naturally we were told by tan not ask questions my ta would often ask my question back me tell me they werent allowed answer my question or say something like well would do you think which isnt very helpful if you genuinely dont know what youre doing i also found tan very condescending during first lab i was struggling with improvements lab section when i asked feedback he essentially told me it was terrible hes seen kids do better offered little feedback or suggestions he also did not show up many subsequent labs so youre completely reliant your ta i feel like i didnt have great one tldr how much your ta likes teaching determines how much fun youll have this course if you arent good at physics please avoid at all costs i sincerely hope this class is better person', 'honestly ta makes or breaks course if you have option take this online take it just try make appointments with ta 1 1 help with lab reports or else it will genuinely be hard', 'horrendously difficult poorly taught felt useless', 'absolutely awful im not going name names because my ta was nice its just that nothing was clear whatsoever i honestly didnt have problem with it first 2 labs because majority content was clear understand then couple weeks professor sent class announcement say stop asking your tas questions thats not what their job is then what is their job professors excuse was that tas are getting paid this their only working hours are 3 hour check sessions that happen biweekly so at my lab 4 check i tried ask my ta questions about uncertainty calculations formula substitution etc he kept interrupting me telling me he didnt have time answer questions so essentially none work is taught tas will never answer questions worst part is that its so clear that professor tas dont want actually teach course so they pass off their unwillingness teach as developing student initiative i have never taken physics my life which may be why i struggled bit more with this course but my lab partner had taken physics years before taking this course she had same overall experience maybe it was worse because it was taken online or at least im hoping because i have phys 112l next semester or maybe it was just awful because nothing was taught or explained but prof tas expected everyone understand content perfectly', 'yes this is truly terribly run lab that is made much more difficult than it should be i came out with decent mark but this was course that i dreaded being apart firstly background information given is vague can be confusing theory is easy because you learn this phys 111 lecture but everything else is difficult because you are given so little information about lab they also expect you know how calculate certain uncertainties but dont actually teach you how they just give you long pdf that is hard understand if youve never calculated uncertainties before tas some are decent others are completely useless might as well not show up what was even more shocking me is that he had some tas that couldnt speak english properly communicate effectively english considering this is school that teaches courses english i found that extremely inappropriate how is ta supposed help students when they cant communicate with them properly other than that lot tas were condescending had attitude lot them clearly did not want be there were not interested taking time help students overall do not take this lab unless it is required course if you absolutely have take this course mentally prepare yourself one worst courses you will take first year prepare well before lab ask lots questions dont do your lab reports last second also dont let tas intimidate you or make you feel stupid not understanding something i will not be tolerating their sh t anymore once i start phys 112l confront them if you have', 'truthfully worst course i have ever taken my entire life this is not exaggeration course is split into 5 labs all worth 20 your grade it is out 18 marks easily can lose marks because there are zero instructions provided that which is is very confusing basically puzzle try understand itself overall if you get hang your tas marking because they are literally what run this course all mark differently use same format once you get hang it its fairly straight forward working with peers is literally what got me through this course', 'literally one worst courses ive ever had i highly recommend not taking it if its not requirement theres ton new statistics content it it has nothing do with your regular physics class professor tas are extremely vague provide little no help even when asked heavily relied whatever information we found online prayed god it was correct no resources or videos are posted by anyone even guide you little through process even grade distribution is joke theres 5 labs each is worth 20 mess up one your entire average will take huge hit again i recommend not taking it', 'this is coming 1st year undergrad who did ok high school physics even though i hated it if you think phys 111 is disorganized phys111l is something else i hate this course with passion firstly there is barely any background information what include your lab reports if there is it is too broad with that mind seeing as i receive different ta marking my assignments each time overall requirements do not even matter when tas have there own preferences communication content ideas related concepts taught phys 111 is horrendous yes i got conduct cool experiments which i enjoyed but there werent any set stone guidelines what values include your lab report whole premise behind this course is that it gives you freedom examine improve your experiment but that idea is really just fa ade if you dont like physics do not take this course if physics is your forte go it content is just 5 labs but tas instructor barely communicate proper guidelines as if they want you fail retake it again it only thing i really learned was how apply physics equations real life matters which really is not unique or mind blowing any sense my last words advice if you are planning taking this course you are not well rounded phys 111 avoid at all counts if you are planning going med school biomedical sciences at waterloo is great but biology would be better choice yes there is physics mcat but it is better review these concepts your own time rather then risk you own gpa with disorganized courses like these i am glad i dropped this course when i did not worth your time if you dont like premise that goes everything else life too', 'it was cool just took so much time out day ta was helpful', 'i mean this nicest way possible i can muster prof ta are rude there is also miscommunication between two parties example one excel video created by prof he mentions you dont have start at origin scatter plot because points are way above origin y axis then when i do just that my lab report ta takes mark off there are so many other examples that i can mention but you get point funny thing is they dont tell you if your improvement is wrong or anything during meeting fact they agree use improvement but then take off marks lab report because proposal isnt strong enough they never tell you what is considered strong improvement until fourth lab not mention marking is very subjective depending which ta you have friend mine told me she didnt have use propagation error while my section was told that we must include it its not that this course is extremely difficult it has more do with miscommunication subjective marking', 'i did this virtually because covid 19 few words this lab course is ordeal first year student because it is highly ta dependent with vague instructions how write university level lab reports we had do labs at home while thinking implementing improvements our own which is hard time consuming your improvement would be good or bad depending your ta', 'this review is based first year student doing this course during covid era fall 2020 course is heavily dependent who your ta is since lab instructor just makes one video explaining what experiment we are doing every other week lab manual that is provided is extremely vague you will have ask many questions your classmates ta guaranteed experiments themselves are quite interesting but actual lab report format contains same exact questions each lab marking course was basically 20 each lab 5 labs total which i personally did not like compared chem 120l biol 130l courses which had many more aspects course were honestly more enjoyable as whole overall be sure ask questions when you need pay attention phys 111 course as many aspects transfer over lab course as well', 'i think this specific lab course is not as bad as it seems i quite enjoy writing lab reports be honest they give lot guidance everything is pretty much given you you just have put it all together', 'i cannot stress this enough make sure you completely understand lab instructions before every lab that includes first lab as well it may be difficult understand instructions because theyre written be way more complicated than they should be if you dont understand anything instructions go open labs they hold before your assigned lab period entire lab course is so disorganized point where lab tas didnt know what do sometimes also good thing know before you take this course is youre expected do lab complete calculations hand completed lab report with discussion conclusion before end 3 hour lab period', 'very ta dependent i got amazing ta who was fair marker also was really good at explaining things this is such stressful lab simply because you have write lab report during lab time its time crunch but its doable', 'highllyyyy ta dependent cuz you will never see dr tan dinh lmao i think i saw him walk out our class like once pray knowledgable ta because otherwise youre screwed my ta was clear but hard marker which i rather have than vice versa try do experiment as quickly as possible because graphing calculating uncertainties everything will take up rest class everyone basically rushed at end because i dont think enough time is given however since i was learning basically nothing phys 111 this course was useful understanding overlapping concepts idk if this course is curved or what because i calculated my mark be 76 but ended with 82', 'labs are okay but thing that sucked was that not only did you have complete experiment 3 hours but also post lab report how well you do is quite dependent your ta if theyre hard marker or not you never see lab instructor himself labs are run by tas going over lab doing as much it as you can before actual lab will help save time so you can finish it also open lab experiments are useful go see what it is youre working with next lab', 'pray u get good ta', 'they make you do everything 3 hour lab period which is almost impossible considering you have run experiment analyze data calculate uncertainties also topics covered each lab were really basic like grade 11 material kinematics addition vectors forces energy', 'lab itself wasnt hard getting report done allotted time period wasnt hard what was difficult was including all stupid calculations they wanted error propagation uncertainty that arent included actual manual if it wasnt including uncertainties every little thing i couldve been out with hour spare beyond uncertainty though labs themselves were easy if you your partner have mindset n out then you shouldnt have problem make sure you do as much as you can ahead time id even go as far as writing out my conclusion leaving blank spaces my values throughout just so id have as much extra time as necessary i also would suggest taking this lab as night lab just because those classes are usually smaller sometimes tas actually feel you more give you extra time our ta night lab let us stay until 10 10 sometimes it didnt negatively impact our mark whatsoever if you put effort you can get 90 im finishing with 93 lab despite finding course ridiculously difficult', 'you have finish lab report by end session first two labs were manageable understandable if you spend few hours reading manual attending prelab understand equipment you are working with afterwards you are required do std deviation analysis large data sets class by hand tbh how could you possibly finish everything 2h50min when you have do experiment analyse so much data explain it too last 3 labs i found myself scrambling piece report together i was blessed that one my tas is very smart knows experiment inside out but too bad amount time given is way too little complete report even if you prepare ahead time labs are too math intensive be finished time so my tip would be get as many marks as possible first 2 labs just do best you could last 3 parts you dont finish do sample calculation explain your thought process but other than that might just have pray you get good ta first year physics lab uw kinda sucks', 'starting third lab theres literally little no time write proper report after experiments tip i give all my friends are attend sessions where tas teach you how use equipment just write as much as you can before you go into lab group work truly matters physics labs find someone thats reliable trustful', 'fairly easy course tas dont know whats going lot time so make sure you read pre lab material even do some extra research fair grading labs no final', 'good thing this lab is only 3 hours biweekly because i didnt like it at all lab manual is confusing hard follow i feel bad tas this lab because most people dont really know what theyre doing so theyre very often needed hopefully you get good ta who knows whats going 3 hours this lab consisted being very confused scrambling finish lab report since they are due at end lab however because they are due at end lab you dont need work them outside lab its good idea prep lab advance though so you at least kind know what youre doing be warned first lab is actual lab so you need be ready unlike chem 123l biol 130l where first labs were just introductions no experiments were done also after first 2 labs you will need make your own data tables my partner i would share work making tables by making them google docs but leaving blank spaces where we could fill calculations our data there also used be final lab exam this course but it was removed now each lab report is worth 20 be glad we dont have final lab exam though because it would be terrible', 'lab book is dumb doesnt state instructions clearly all directions are vague some tas are not helpful', 'honestly i dont want be too harsh but course is so poorly designed tas dont even understand half experiments but they expect you most concepts is just graphical analysis which no one ever teaches you so you have teach yourself just take l move dont even waste your time trying get good grade', 'fairly easy physics', 'not sure if course was severely dumbed down previous terms but it was very easy fair i previously took dropped phys 131l which was way harder than this course i usually walked into lab without having even looked at days experiment finished with time spare final you dont have memorize slopes graphs if you understand theory behind them but theres no formula sheet so you will need remember those', 'pre laboratory work is required if you want complete lab effectively stress free lab manual is not very clear many aspects lab reports are not specified within manual often new calculations were added at beginnings each lab content was relevant however using physical equipment force table linear air track ball bearing cannon was fun', 'lab involves experiments like attaching box string suspending string over pulley using that data calculate frequency uv light given off star another solar system other words no one knows what hell is going good thing about this lab is that you dont really have think about anything you just mindlessly follow instructions manual use equations that you may encounter as quantum physics phd student at harvard as my nanna used always say aim high shoot low you hope 80 lab but realistically you pray 55 final lab exam has average about 30 it really just involves you memorizing slope log plots each experiment which you didnt even do first place', 'honestly my whole class had really hard time understanding our ta because he did not speak understand english very well we had figure out what do our own every lab since every time we asked ta help he did not know answer our question when it comes exam you just have memorize formulas wing it', 'i dont know if it was just my ta or if everyone else had bad ones i found this lab be pretty straightforward you have make sure you have decent understanding before doing actual lab other words read over lab procedures before day lab first lab will probably catch people off guard because they kind just throw you there but labs after that arent bad at all however if you are slow writer or if it takes you long time finish actual lab order record data i can see why you would hate this lab being efficient worker properly organizing your data collected being able write decent conclusion error analysis half hour is pretty essential if you can do this then netting at least 80 your reports shouldnt be problem also 90 percent reports you do are filling blanks filling up tables be wary final though', 'wish they could make it clear how write report before i lost all marks supper hard achieve over 80 reports theres always something wrong with your report make no mistakes experiment theres no time you correct it i read everything before each lab but it is still hard understand what are we doing however after ta explains i did get better understanding concepts we learned phys 111 also exam was fair', 'by far worst lab i had my first term i had ta who could not speak english very well so that miscommunication lost me marks some experiments which was annoying labs were always rushed there was frenzied panic at end session finish bogus discussion conclusion there was always something that screwed me out couple percentage points each experiment exam was also bad vaguest suggestions study exam was given namely just study theory behind experiments i did not study exam as long as i would have liked mostly sleep deprivation causing me sleep later than i should have exam day by some stroke luck i managed pass course with 80 so i am really glad that happened i thought that i had bombed final overall i disliked lab everyone i spoke felt same way only saving grace about lab was that you did not have spend too much time preparing each lab during week', 'i never understood what was happening lab i just followed instructions went with it nothing still makes sense me my ta didnt really explain anything', 'if you dont have take this course dont take it professor tries his hardest make labs impossible finish exam is full ridiculous questions i did well but paid dearly blood sweat tears so many tears', 'depends ta you have whether theyre kind enough help you set up equipment instructions were confusing', 'hope pray you pass unpassable final', 'i hated physics labs most mainly because way it is structured along with most horrible corrupted teaching assistants who are absolutely unfair with marking everyone knows that this lab is intended discourage you rather than actually promote interest physics so dont be upset if youre not getting grade you deserve its very normal', 'no homework or preparation which is convenient but you have work fast once you get lab order finish your report time all reports must be started finished within your lab period pretty boring experiments most part lots graph drawing', 'pretty terrible lab pre lab prep is must if you want achieve any thing over than standard 75 which everyone seems get unless you really goof up experiment leave large portions blank most annoying aspect is that all labs are hand at end 3 hour period', 'this course helps you understand real world

easy follow as well as interesting assignments are not dreadful complete as most them were reflecting past scenarios situations connecting it textbook', 'wish i had more time this course since i actually found content pretty interesting it just gets way really important courses assignments are boring', 'very chill course content was very easy but maybe thats what made it not very interesting had this course with shannon hartling could tell that she very much enjoyed teaching this course she partnered us up with classmate we had meet couple times throughout term talk about specific topic

easy', 'textbook provided some nice insights into interpersonal relationships ive come out changed man after skimming textbook while writing weekly journals that said this course sucks you have 10 written journal assessments you receive grade feedback 1 them just random grade no feedback another one remaining 8 you receive no grade at all finally random mark appears your report card not only does lack feedback impede you learning but it also enables prof give you arbitrary marks not fun but also not that much time sink though it sucks losing study time it during finals', 'enjoyable i guess still kind felt pointless mostly common sense stuff like if you curse at someone they are likely curse back stuff like this', 'i actually really liked this course was surprised by low reviews

was able humanize what was otherwise very rough 1a term me he took time learn everyones name i did not feel as if i was number unlike my other courses we would have weekly live face face meetings

his grade breakdown was very easy no exam 3 non cumulative midterms worth 20 each 10 class clickers 2 5 marks incorrect answer 5 5 correct 10 tutorial clickers same marking scheme also clicker grades get multiplied by 1 15 at end theres 40 mark bonus that goes into class clicker if you register by certain date 10 online quizzes with unlimited attempts 10 assignments best 3 4 taken later changed 2 3 essentially this was not only free 40 but more example my final clicker grade was about 125 you could basically get 85 this class without knowing any statistics believe me provided you take advantage free 40 this was only good thing about riley offset this it was very clear that riley intended make midterms absolute slaughters he did not plan giving us any formulas his examples class were way too simple you could tell he was gonna make them much more difficult tests also riley tried have us learn r programming language tutorials which appeared midterms this class was 99 science students with 0 interest programming so im not sure what he was thinking i could write dissertation about only how useless disorganized r tutorials were once riley got aids though course was taken over by dina dawoud james adcock both them did fine job considering how abruptly they were thrust into running someone elses course also they realized that riley not giving us formula sheet violated geneva convention decided bless us with one riley seemingly was too ill contribute midterm 1 evidenced by his name not being it as it was very straightforward class average was high 78 apparently his aids symptoms regressed time midterm 2 but aids also became contagious because midterms 2 3 had his name were much much harder averages were 69 after denominator drop 63 i can only imagine how low averages would have been if only riley wrote them we were not given formula sheets riley also apparently did not create assignments this course ahead time as dina james did not give fourth one us

compared my executable sample executable they give test your output against my executable had half memory leaks but you wont know that youll failed secret tests until after deadline because they dont even give you release tokens spec they give you assignments is verbose unclear full holes youll read literally 6 pages still not know what do then youll have read every post piazza just have something

not recommend it anyone it was so easy fall behind concepts not fully understand things prof doesnt ever respond emails which is just peachy so good luck getting help there were weekly group assignments where you needed actually say something chat show that you participated normally everyone just said heres my answer i agree off we went midterm was online i think you had day do it but it wasnt easiest thing out there there were also weekly assignments quizzes so basically your final is only worth 50 concepts arent super confusing but way its taught is tried get help tutors students who were physics at other universities they were just as stumped i recommend finding someone whos doing well course befriending them so that you have chance actually learning otherwise goodluck i did take this course agai boost my grade though taking it class is whole different ball game profs are way better at explaining concepts had idziak material actually is very easy all online assignments

demo everyday keep things interesting he is also incredibly nice understanding prof there are clicker questions but this time you also have get answer right get full marks try sit with friends so you can discuss questions', 'important do practice questions memorize simple equations that arent given exam sheet', 'if you thought 111 was bad youll probably also think 112 is bad while questions might

question each ta marks different page so that marks are more fair many concept based questions its either you get full marks question or no marks labs general were extremely fun do most shouldnt take more than couple hours each tas lab instructors we had two so other one took over starting with experiment 4 were very chill so dont be afraid ask them questions i didnt find this lab as easy as other

exploit it treat it as weekly ddls as normal never think accumulating all unfinished problems until classes are over do exploit his office hours you dont even need come up clear good question just

once you get hang them dont be scared syntax or get intimidated at beginning it gets much easier as you get used it with coq you will discover exactly what rigorous really means i know many classmates who wish they could use coq other classes because it makes them feel more confident correctness their proof numericals are as one reviewer put it different beast you will probably spend more time them than coq proofs even though they are worth less premise numerical is that you are given concept some guiding questions about concept you are asked 1 provide correct answers guiding questions which are typically pretty easy 40 marks 2 extend your understanding by asking your own questions doing your own testing with concepts then coming up with conjectures definitions proofs your own patterns you find your own exploration 60 this second task will take long ass time if you do it properly but it is very rewarding there is really no other course where you will get same opportunity explore content

learn how rigorously build up integers many their properties properties rings fields general using proof assistant coq learning how properly do proofs using coq assignments was invaluable experience

6 weeks as result i failed my hs unit test that made me extremely nervous this course because electricity was never something ive ever understood well boy was i wrong lectures were clear alongside

hours weekly quizzes are wonderful sense that they ask you most pointless questions like what dye is used spore stain youd reply with malachite green but because you didnt list percentage dye you only

youll take second year it is most useless lecture attendance is mandatory because iclicker questions so is purchasing textbook i found this be waste time money because you literally have read chapter

tas were very anal unapproachable which made this course unenjoyable lot people', 'really liked course as long as you keep up with readings you should be fine with 80 memorization is key study

there is disconnect between material two take this course spring if you can labs are so much fun minus mosquitos you need buy textbook though online quizzes beware buying online version though as it can be difficult flip through sections book when completing quizzes if you like nature want know more about how ecosystems work take this course it is not bird course though since lab report due is lot work do first lab you pick 1 3 your life will be much easier since 3rd lab is due at end term when you will have many other assignments due', 'fairly graded exam material no assignments showing up

actually learned lot although it was difficult if youre willing work it you can come out with great mark still', 'i did pretty well this course rebecca rooney was really nice professor definitely professor worth having undergrad', 'great prof hes super nice posts material all one webpage which made it easy navigate he adds short lectures but most content is learnt simutext which is virtual textbook with many practice questions content throughout term was easy although there were many assignments that could be time consuming if you were leave it all at last minute there were reading quizzes at end each textbook chapter each was worth less than percent very easy there were also concept maps discussion posts couple lab simulations if you dont do so well assignment dont stress he only only counts best 4 5 concept maps 4 5 discussion posts etc theres no midterm or term tests just final exam although that was bit difficult since there are no term tests or midterm it may be little hard test your understanding especially with math side course i also felt as if time limit given was bit stressful still aside final exam i loved learning content course it was my favourite that semester its shame im not interested field ecology but this course was great', 'boring uses only online textbook which was easy read but somewhat redundant software also wasnt always cooperative content was lots common sense concepts with some obscure formulas thrown it wasnt super clear how apply formulas or interpret results outside very specific examples that were talked about way too long thankfully course didnt require much time overall though i woud recommend starting modules couple days before theyre due becuase they can be long boring plus you dont want get stuck with technical issues day its due also you were expected make several discussion posts so i would just recommend pretending youre dumb didnt understand incredibly simple concepts when asking questions when you are answering questions overexplain maybe throw something slightly related', 'where do i begin liam my love oh sweet liam literally my favourite professor this entire term hes absolute sweetheart genuinely enjoys what hes teaching he also shares little extra stuff he does field as well its so wholesome i like simutext because its way study interactively without feeling like youre stressed

makes it hard get good grades them initially i did improve got high grades my last three but first two were rough', 'i hated this course at first didnt give it shot rest term but i regret it weather stuff beginning is super boring but i now understand that its needed i wish i stayed engaged because animal behaviour unit was amazing', 'as student who took this online during covid 19 course was

this course fall 2020 completely online due covid dont know how this course is normally when it is person but i found it be very easy remotely dr rooney clearly wants you get highest mark you possibly

2019 i personally thought that this course was not very useful at least me it contained lot information that i considered be common sense it went into lot detail about relatively simple concepts that being said i did think that course was relatively easy midterm exam were both fair however online quizzes were very odd meant trick you this class we also used simbio module which was interactive

would get overwhelmed with amount people help there should be 2 tas there at all times run this lab more efficiently often times i would have wait almost 5 minutes every time i had question may not

how functional language actually works hardware these topics were covered only briefly though i expect there are entire upper year courses dedicated them switch cs 135 into 146 was quite easy very smooth transition there may be couple unfamiliar features full racket that arent taught 135 but theyre easy catch if you found 135 easy boring definitely give 146 shot plus getting 100 assignments 146

expected syntax c racket used this course is quick learn but expect figure out lot details behind interpreter assignments i started crashing isas office hours q5 almost every one them afterwards c questions are lot more doable but beware memory pointer stuff or your program wont even compile also i learned limit my debugging time by end set up threshhold like 8 10 above which i only perfect my

each other so do them all same deal as cs145 release tokens you get see if you pass all tests or not so getting 100 assignments worth 60 grade is very feasible we were given 9 days complete final

there were also some case studies that were talked about during tutorials that had questions integrated into quizzes midterms were also fair had similar questions quizzes but was bit more application based personally i felt exam had trickier questions compared midterms quizzes but it s not hard do well this course if you just attend lectures regularly review your notes there s not whole lot practice you can do this course other than some simple thermodynamics calculations but it s important stay updated content since there are lot specific details that you are expected remember can be

mandatory labs if you miss 2 labs you automatically fail course as result you are forced waste 80 minutes labs each week going over material that was already covered you dont get feedback midterm she purposefully does not give you any feedback at all your midterm as result not only are you unable argue marks but you cant learn your mistakes either whole point course is learn how are you supposed learn if you dont know what you did wrong overall carayannopoulos does immaculate job at countering student learning i feel sympathetic all students that have go through this horrendous course', 'lot people hate this course since there are so many group projects mandatory weekly labs which is true but i found course enjoyable as it is useful i can actually apply knowledge real life labs took me back high school classes as size was small we could get know our peers i was very lucky have my new venture group members we became good friends even after bu111 my ta was really nice as well she made labs amazing', 'you shouldnt be taking this class if youre not double degree its too much timesink business concepts are mostly common sense youll get frustrated when marks get docked inexact wording

take this course unless you absolutely have i have never taken course that has such bad organisation if you do have take this course realise that it is completely bullshit writing totally subjective

lose marks example they do not share slides or examples anything shown labs even though we are suppose make sure you follow that format assignments lastly they treat students like they are elementary school i understand that its first year course but restricting electronics class having us do bunch stupid exercises that are pointless waste time is just degrading really is too bad because they

engaging however sos sessions lab manual help lot terms understanding content', 'labs are fun but lectures are very dry make sure go sos sessions memorize slides if you want 80 exams', 'probably one most useful courses i have take my undergrad course content is quite straightforward not most interesting however group projects presentations really build your soft skills like communication working

does few decent concepts which should have taken 2 weeks not 4 months cover', 'terrible course', 'didnt like it first have with all cases midterm but i then i started find it more interesting with newer topics i ended up enjoying new venture more than i thought i would', 'memorization based half concepts are common sense but might be hard recall exam attend lectures', 'pretty cool course learn

courses are useless general this one was no exception required lot hard work material was interesting only 25 time', 'dont get how they mark test', 'learned vast variety business concepts', 'i found this course be fairly easy it wasnt really what i expected though i was looking course that might teach me how open run business but this course seemed focus more markets developing ideas rather than building more fundamental skills management', 'i had drop this class during my spring term because it would have tanked my average i took it online so no lectures just prerecorded stuff textbook amount stuff you had learn per module was intense as psych major i was forced take it it is very much strictly biology no psych about it my opinion they would do 3 quizzes then larger test those three modules chapters quizzes were great easy i did really well but i would tank tests prof would mess up questions lot too so when i did meeting with ta talk about possible mistake she said ya we made this class even harder purpose since its open book even though there is already insane amount material you have remember just didnt seem fair since this is already hard class information was interesting but just so much try get hang when quizzes tests are completely different style', 'very interesting quite similar psych 207 weekly quzzies each worth 2 4 tests each worth 19 readings lectures are huge help took online spring 2022 barely studied did okay', 'taking this my psych minor arts student i pretty much dislike this course very much first test wasnt bad all test quizzes after that its interesting interesting bad lol content isnt bad i just dont like testing this course reminds me why im not stem', 'really interesting course but very very science focused it is basically biology course online version was very easy do well with 4 non cumulative open book tests i definitely would have suffered lot more if this was person', 'terrible course i have no idea why this is labeled psychology course it is full fledged biology course endless boring content professor threw videos that someone else made at us said good luck i saw her one tutorial never saw her again only reason i did ok course is cuz it was online open book no idea how i was going do it without these things tas were ok one them refused upload tutorial video because she was insecure about how she sounded video she only uploaded it day before test overall terrible course that is coming psych science student good luck if you have take this', 'cool course but like 1 3 content is straight out biol 373 except less detailed if you are bio or life sci student this is easy 90 tests were open book 4 x 25 many questions were taken word word out lecture videos take thorough notes you will have most

tests each one covered 3 weeks content they were open book as well if you put effort you can get good grade learn lot', 'i love course but god it is difficult definitely pay more attention lectures over textbook readings cuz you will be tested lot it', 'if you are psych major take this course online while you can its hard course if you want easier online term it will ruin that sure but if you have memorize same amount content online as you do person you will hate your life term you take this person open book tests saved me dan smilek is amazing prof i dont know how i would have passed without those 2 things', 'if youre science student have taken biol 130 biol 273 373 this course will be very easy most content overlaps with human physiology courses remaining content is much similar that you learn biology courses as second year student biomed i would highly recommend this course as bird course course you will need put work get good mark but overall i would highly recommend also dan smilek is great professor who teaches thoroughly gives you tough but fair examinations my favorite course best mark ive taken university as yet', 'take biol 130 before hand if you have no background sciences youll find course incredibly difficult time consuming i took biol130 fall almost everything i learnt that class applies this one highly recommend daniel smilek as prof this class

different opinion but if youre curious about how body works at all make effort take good notes 90 is definitely attainable', 'if you dont know anything about biology this course is going be so difficult prof that i had taught course as if we were all bio majors us psych students were lost whole time', 'very hard if youre not science could be very interesting course with interesting content

taken biol 273 content is incredibly interesting i fully recommend taking it with dr smilek hes amazing', 'favourite psych course lots important interesting content i actually looked forward going class every time tests arent easy kind nit picky so you have study im science so i had leg up but i still had study get great mark if your goal is just pass youre science its very easy lectures have more information than textbook so make sure you attend or you will sure miss out marks had dr smilek he was amazing very approachable knows his stuff he likes reference things further learning books articles videos as well which i thought was really cool creates lecture hall where you feel comfortable participating asking questions as well', 'hard class lots studying but it is important content 50 cumulative final online version can be brutal study', 'i personally did not find this course interesting but if you are really interesting brain then you will like this course it is science based

learned already although attending lectures is must also stay top readings if you put work easy 85', 'if you have science background this course should be pretty easy 90 online quizzes help highlight important concepts i found going class really helped me you dont need textbook', 'difficult if you do not remember study chemical processes brain fellow arts psych students diagrams will not save you

dont recommend taking this course online online version lectures are only about 30 minutes long per week they only highlight important information but do not teach you anything really you are expected learn all content textbook readings aka you have teach yourself everything course basically most midterm content was found only readings not discussed at all lectures online midterms were okay but questions were all over place if youre psych student youll probably find this course pretty tough as it is very sciencey requires ton memorization if youre science student take this course

would advise not do because it is hard there is lot reading online lectures can be little dry it was my only course while co op thankfully i would not do this online if youre full course load get started reading as early as possible i think thats biggest advice terms content it was exactly what i was looking what areas brain were involved what processes how those processes worked why structures like pinna are shaped way they are but only later chapters did it talk about integrative concepts such as emotion midterms seemed have some clinical based questions such as if x if damaged

outlined at beginning very well content was enjoyable interesting tests were fair fairly easy given that they were open book but i bet all information would have made person closed book tests challenging', 'loveddddd this course pinheiro is gem content was so interesting if this course isnt req you take it anyway', 'coming first year biology student this course has been fairly straightforward involves lot memorization personally i didnt find this course that interesting but pinheiro has made it fairly enjoyable it is easy do well this class mark breakdown involved 15 group work which was probably only time i was sociable this year not bad at all marks coming this part course are usually coming up with just one multiple choice question based previous weeks content easy 15 10 comes completing textbook questions which weight would be moved midterm final exam if you dont purchase 30 came lab online this was easy 30 as well lol remaining marks come 15 midterm 30 final both which include fair questions as long as you have good notes i think biggest mistake students this course can make is having poor no notes otherwise you can expect good results', 'pinherio is best prof youll ever have course is hard takes lot memorization but i definitely think that lab is what makes it so much fun we had these amazing tas laura mitch they hands down were stars this course if

marcel pinheiro i thought it was great class which was taught well content can be bit dry depending where your interests lie but marcel always made lectures fun engaging lot information covered was new not much was review high school content was relatively easy understand but there is lot memorization especially comparison between different species studied midterm exam were both fair textbook is not essential but can be great help understanding certain concepts my professor also did assign readings it each chapter involved this course there is also essential laboratory component it consisted 5 labs using microscopes drawing slides which was very tedious 5 dissections lab was great get lot hands experience using lab equipment overall it was enjoyable course not too difficult', 'this class textbook is not required since all questions tested midterms final exam was off lecture slides labs this course is content heavy but is very interesting there were three writing assignments which at end term based peer review you pick one final marking this course has one midterm lab final exam clicker questions participation oder pass this course you have pass lab component but is quite easy do

memorizing textbook isnt needed if you memorize lab manual his slides you are set easy peasy 90', 'pinheiro is amazing professor', 'such fun course take but it gets pretty hard pinherio is very engaging as prof makes this topic less pain learn about course goes into lot detail life cycles different organisms their specific characteristics lots scientific names that are hard remember too i suggest making cue cards with different phyla names them so you can practice them throughout term theyre key knowing what midterm exam questions are talking about exam wasnt too bad if you studied hard it lab component course was super useful gave you hand experience with some animals that you talk about lecture i recommend reading through lecture slides lab manual before going into lab since there are lab quizzes after every dissection lab exam is extremely difficult so start studying early its powerpoint presentation where they show you pictures organisms that you looked at lab with arrows pointing something often what seems like nothing they ask 2 4 simple questions it like what is this structure what phyla is this etc this is also very helpful if you take biol 165', 'not my

do great as he provides you with his own notes course so you dont need read textbook provides answers hw questions gives you breakdown what you need know exam gives students previous exams study off

memorize youll be fine its actually pretty cool if i recall correctly theres little section converting numbers between decimal binary number systems this was insanely easy me simply because i knew my powers two memorize them up at least 2 10 this will be breeze also knowing powers two comes handy many applications down road last thing comes back matrices you will hear words gaussian elimination gauss jordan elimination row echelon form reduced row echelon form thrown around all over place also forward elimination backward substitution learn explicitly what these things actually mean what differences are so you can forget about all silly words just do it once you realize youve actually been doing this years you just didnt put matrix box around it before linear systems will be piece cake', 'this class sounds awesome theory i took class kind like this high school i loved it so i thought it would be good class get my arts credit out way i took it online spring no matter how good i

honestly just took it fill breadth requirement but i liked it it helps that i like art digital media so i found my time well spent here', 'i am not fine arts student so i found it frustrating that i was graded like one nowhere course description were prerequisites mentioned but my lack art concept affected my grade i ended up with 82 course had no feedback along way you learn photoshop solely

so outlandishly beyond us point it was wholly exercise futility something professor mann seemed recognize assured us would not be tested yet long difficult graded assignment was still issued it i can understand showing us general intro grs concepts but actually going into its mathematics is ridiculous what i did learn this course was incredible wonderful made it all more unfortunate that such could not be done justice because this course tries condense all frontiers physics into single course first years i understand appreciate idea is introduce advanced concepts order get us acquainted thinking about these ideas early so that we will be more receptive them later but ultimately i doubt i will retain much if any concepts too advanced be learned properly at this level i would prefer just learn such concepts at appropriate level with requisite background when time comes rather than cramming it here where it is huge stress little if any gain while simultaneously cutting short other

typo textbook was useless understand i used another profs course notes we were forced use perusall which we were marked productiveness our conversations also system tracking reading time underreported

would be one theorem another class is 3 this textbook this is very annoying when every assignment has you cite exact theorem or definition number over over which wasted so much time we had do 3 4

time taken like 30 random textbook questions every week no joke i spent 10 hours straight assignment still didnt finish it most questions required ridiculous numbers computations where each individual step had be written down midterm had two typos one was minor other fundamentally changed question she did not update crowdmark with fixed version but sent out email just slightly before midterm saying

very good but pay attention do your work', 'content wasnt hard we just had lot assignments being 1a at time i did not realize that having 30 assignments total by end term was lot lol terms content

know are legit all same but slight modifications so if you know general thing youre good also hint get tophat do extra questions they often put questions extra questions onto midterms finals trend i noticed so if you do you can knock few questions out i cant say how difficult final is cause during covid it was made open book', 'get ready work hard this course is difficult is so far toughest 2nd year chemistry course general science field yes it will be tough memorize more than 70 different chemical synthesis all other spectroscopy stuff but they are fair game exam do problem sets over over

difficult when material hadnt been covered class yet both midterm final are legendary not resembling course content at all there were many large concepts repeatedly mentioned throughout course that didnt show up once exams meanwhile memorizing random things like how knives are made ytrria stabilized zirconia made their way exam when it was only shown one time this one slide this one lecture minute there could even be question exam requiring you use brand new equation youve never seen before found messiest equation sheet possible so ultimately even if you actually manage self teach

hardest course i have taken thus far uni amount content is insane but you just have get through it i ended up coming out with really good grade but thats because i started studying week before tests

things lot easier understand', 'i loved this course but its integral stay top readings every week biggest mistake that you could make is leaving content back burner until midterm final i would advise

all leak into each other lack clear distinctions there were weekly assignments where you had answer bunch questions lecture then answer questions during tutorial there were i believe 2 midterms final you will not have enough time complete them my advice take it fall so you can suffer with your fellow students content is less atrocious but fall prof is equally horrible she would get angry at students call them disappointments asking simple questions this course is exemplification why profs are not teachers just tenured research scientists that think they actually know what theyre doing

attendance but it can be quite frustrating as she often talks too quickly skips sections or theres just simply not enough space write it all one great thing is that she records her lectures this class takes huge amount time effort at end you may walk away wondering what exactly it was that you learned i can also say however that it was most useful class hands down during my subsequent co op i ended

its easier with miskovic so take with her if you would like keep your sanity i find that with reed marsden it is impossible do well even if i stay up date every week understand memorize slides even if

this with dr reed dr marsden it is very content heavy course so do not fall behind at any point semester start strong end strong do well both midterm final listen hints they give class or things they highlight yellow ppts these will often show up tests reed is very particular with terminology he is detail orientated mungo is more into overall processes how things work both professors are great i would recommend watching supplementary material they post reinforce your understanding get most out course make sure you follow up every lecture by making your own set notes watching extra youtube videos supplement most important thing about course like this is not fall behind everything builds itself so attend class stay top it make sure you nail down definitions can label diagrams when studying try grasp overall processes going understand that most time it is pathway simple reactions you will see them several times this general format ligand binds receptor which activates protein which turns off repressor allows transcription factor work pathways are very easy pull questions questions like explain how pathway works or what happens when you mutate certain component it example

quizzes they are repeated tests work hard you can score very high', 'super interesting', 'honestly such interesting course beginning everything seems so disconnected but as you move through course it

adts data structures', 'not too difficult you just need start your assignments early if youre luck enough get naomi youll have all resources you need tas are also super helpful', 'assignments were easy lots algorithm analysis data structures adts so little bit memorization profs midterm final questions were pretty long so thats what made them difficult lol otherwise useful course terms programming memory is not handled', 'truthfully garbage whole course could be condensed into week course notes are terrible unhelpful we were given no information about midterm other than modules it was no idea what questions would be like anyways easy but painful', 'course varies depending prof my term concepts were easy understand assignments were fair however both midterm final were quite

'students who took cs136 has great advantage especially when this course starts use pseudocode', 'it is easy course just bit programming mostly runtimes algorithms', 'absolute joke especially if youve taken cs136 not very much coding lots drawing simple diagrams that being said i did enjoy learning about several new data structures algorithms', 'super easy course most it is review cs 136 except python only last couple weeks had new information', 'interesting useful cs theory material taught at very basic level but gives very broad overview', 'very similar cs116 continuation', 'i did not

course i ended up making friends with other people class they spend only small amount time learning how read language move onto sentences pretty quickly so make sure learn how read language read textbook do little extra work outside class youll easily do well all all its been best most fun course ive taken during my program so far', 'learned lot basics reading writing not too much vocabulary was taught enjoyable class', 'loved proff', 'hour week should be enough keep up with material great introduction korean language although not lot vocab was taught', 'it is important go ta when you dont understand because things that you dont understand will continue pile up it is also important go all tutorials because there is where you actually learn most', 'you definitely get very good base learning language system many common grammar points 3 common speech forms', 'it is good course that defiantly allowed me learn about hangul i think it would have been easy course if you put time effort into class if you dont have time put into this course have time memorize i wouldnt recommend this course otherwise it was fun interesting course', 'easiest course ive taken so far mainly because course load is so light', 'lots koreaboos be prepared have class with girls who already know lot korean because k pop i had class with one extremely obnoxious girl who sat at front shouted out answers very easy if you do coursework fill blanks translate super simple stuff i didnt go lectures probably wouldnt have gone tutorials either if it wasnt mandatory', 'pretty easy lots fun tutorials were useful class was only once week we got break every lecture so it was pretty great', 'korean is fun language that anyone can grasp quickly professor kims lectures are always blast homework

stupid imo shaper mechanism project is similar four bar linkage project me 212 also uses matlab but there was skeleton code provided it there were no tutorials this course but they werent necessary since content is fairly easy', 'took me 322 during online spring 2020 term content before midterm is solely focused graphical kinematic analysis mechanical linkages determine acceleration velocity

exams were straightforward', 'had lajimi this course it was pretty useful end i guess except he hated our class', 'one most boring courses term even though its most mechanical first half course is all about four bar linkages its mostly me212 again taught differently second half course i learnt way more about spur gears then i ever care know vibrations is also included at end course its most

you think little about existance technology weekly quizzes bi weekly discussion three assignments easy get high mark if you put little effort', 'got elective out way few written assignments but nothing hard personally felt that grading is unnecessarily harsh', 'took this s19 as elective not directly useful eng but content is intriguing about 1 5 course is essentially free marks ie class

based textbook so make sure buy copy use it everything', 'concepts are quite interesting have some relevance real world however way course is taught is boring is not as easy as people say it is tests assignments are marked extremely hard are extremely subjective i would stay away this course', 'awesome course not important engineering at all but very interesting enjoyed everything about it',

important passing but its really helps give you another perspective subject if youre interested getting good mark assignments dont seem that hard but they can require lot thinking or alternatively bullshitting class participation marks actually require bit thinking but its not unreasonably difficult you group people get together answer some questions slides there are two major 25 tests which basically case studies workshops are just longer class participation sessions overall its not that hard get good mark', 'as boring as course may be it was definitely useful i learned lot things it gave me lot insight into technology world', 'this course if quite easy if you just attend lectures about 15 your grade is class activities anyway there is quite bit writing involved tests expect write 6 9 pages answers essays so do keep that mind too if that is something that alerts you', 'although i found this course mostly boring there were one or two topics that actually changed or reinforced some my viewpoints world technology it made me abhor consumerism more than i already did grading consists 3 short easy essays 2 class written tests easy participation marks as well', 'bird course with lot engineers it need attend lectures because lecture slides are this format bronze frog insert picture then prof tells you story', 'overall interesting topics it can be difficult get high marks

getting you familiar with certain equipment reports were not hard at all lab was pretty related material being taught course which was nice there were no formal lab reports which was nice final was only worth 40 overall grade but was only out 42 it wasnt hard but was easy do poorly if you got few questions wrong definitely 85 lab', 'mark dropped lot after exam', 'probably my favourite chem labs

about how draw these but if you dont get solid understanding them it will go cool absolute torture you will probably die', 'cool hands graphics course we covered different projections learned bit

times i do believe first part dealing with history astronomy was bit uninteresting but course gets much better after that i enjoyed fact that we dove into math regularly that being said some tas grading problem sets are excessive im sure they have good intentions majority them are nice but comments they made my problem sets were passively aggressive frankly really pissed me off comments are supposed make me learn not make me feel like piece shit missing something addition i dont think there was universal grading scheme each problem set because amount points youd get off mistake varies

i might say is that it was bit too easy could have focused more current topics rather than history astronomy over centuries', 'course is very interesting conceptually is simple mathematics but it involves massive amount boring computations midterm final were also heavy computations about 60 time i was doing checking my arithmetic which was rather irritating bi weekly assignments were ok since you have more time computations but they were pretty long heavy computations as well', 'this course is very interesting course that uses high school physics like newtons law gravity basic relativity

this my ta would make more grammatical corrections my case studies than my english assignments ive never seen someone highlight every single word my assignment with vague feedback like why would you use notwithstanding this context you dont need word but like are you bored clearly tas are wrong major because theyre more concerned about grammar than actual written content rubrics assignments were insanely vague there was only 1500 word count max making it nearly impossible even elaborate certain points or provide further supporting evidence tests were insanely difficult too worth 25 each 2

throughout lecture they will definitely help upside 40 60 distribution is that you wont need spend too much time this course at all if you spend just 2 3 days content before exams you will do fine',

are much more helpful content is not particularly hard can be grinded few days', 'lots basic math possibilities mistakes also diff eqs came up late fast', 'lectures were boring tutorials were not very useful too repetitive plus exam content was little unexpected what he had told us plus quiz marking was brutally hard', 'tests were easy short around 4 questions but they did get progressively harder

much time one thing that is very difficult ask clarification lot', 'best course ever it reveals what it means learn something statistical perspective content is hard but was taught rather slowly i

one easiest courses term but its much tougher than math 118 this calculus course feels lot different since its no longer under math faculty there will be way more applications than youd ever want

limited me it seemed impossible get above 80 despite working very hard which is quite frustrating this would have been okay except fact there were no non written assignments boost marks assignments were also monotonous not very interesting or creative i am torn as whether or not i would take course again as i did enjoy content it was interesting but assignments made me dislike course', 'this

was little disappointing but still interesting me disappointing because i thought it would be more applicable real world uses but lot class is only concerned about computability not practicality we care that algorithm exists x problem but we dont care if it runs o n n n n n n time it was interesting though learn about hierarchy languages finally understand how people can prove that something is not computable that is even if we had infinite computing resources we could not solve some problem i always wondered how we could know that this module made interesting complement cs 341 which i was

which were short less than 30 minutes reading per quiz if you pay attention class which is easy do study quizzes you can easily get above 90 im very happy i took this course would recommend it anyone who is looking easy interesting course', 'comments are true simon wood is amazing prof definitely grew appreciation movie music after taking this course had no idea music could have such huge impact

pausing watch re watch video examples there were also assigned movie viewings every week starting week 4 or 5 decent time commitment but you honestly dont need watch them at all however i think you may get bit more out course if you watch them not mention they are all extremely great films that were awesome be exposed as cinema philistine if you have even vaguest interest movies i highly

you definitely worth it best course i have taken my life', 'history based quite bit content but its all related interesting as film develops through 1900s i really wish there was more focus modern day

horribly written that i actually started laugh while reading it there are no diagrams or explanations ho apparatuses work manual seems expect students understand what these uncommon things are tips you want survive maybe even thrive find out content learn when your practice labs are once you know what materials look like how they work you will actually be able breeze through lab make sure make

plopped into most useless ones are most useful 2 light frosting lectures that tip toe over top pit that is textbook work will possibly have example that doesnt relate assigned questions wont actually show how approach it just question then final answer no steps between 3 assigned questions textbook these sometimes give you values then other ones you have assume assumptions will lose you marks but questions cannot be solved without them youll look at these questions not understand them so youll try going through textbook chapters only find they dont help at all so you answer roughly half questions with half baked equation mess learning absolutely nothing 4 you get your assignment back with grade 45 so you check assignment solutions only see some your answers are surprisingly exact same as solution set posted yet you only got 0 5 2 with no indication what you did right or wrong they also have nothing do with chapter you read 5 rinse repeat until enough students complain get told

do it right make sure you know what youre doing every experiment lot my friends got shitty results marks because they rushed their experiments 2 titration is key learn how do it properly 3 watch

you get there early you can start setting up lab make sure wash your equipment every lab best result 7 adding onto 6 read pages lab manual detailing how wash equipment 8 keep eye your equipment dont break lose them you dont wanna end up paying them they are expensive final words personal experience heidi scares me but if you follow above tips you should do fine your tas will be your best friends

at times she also likes spend 10 minutes talking about single diagram picture dr duxbury enjoys teaching this course so i found her be lot more empathetic with her students than ive seen my 2nd year

is tough marker she wants massive wall text every question i did well midterm 90s but i memorized almost everything her slides as soon as clock started i word vomitted it all out onto page she wants

really simple it consisted textbook reading lecture openbook quiz every week there was then follow up tutorial question at end each tutorial which was probably more difficult part course but still

able check over my exam 3 times almost everything about this course was great tas were helpful exams marking were fair only thing i didnt like were assignments which were weekly towards end course

but you dont need background cs it wasnt that difficult general do studying is easy i usually take notes but i took almost no notes after like month still finished mid 90s tedious thing are labs as they are short but require bit effort especially as science student with all labs though your tas can usually help you though labs are only worth 5 so legit if you miss one it doesnt matter but it does give you practice so you dont really need study as much exams assignments are annoying as they can get hard but if you tried tas usually can help you they are worth like 24 so focus weekly

lecture also he did way too much advertising this 477 class i understand he wants people like rf study rf 4th year but his way introduce it is bad other bad thing is he did not do review before he

its not most it is just practice questions some contents are not textbook watch his lectures properly because his practice quizzes come them i watched them after he uploaded them learn because i watch them at x1 5 speed practice quizzes are every week but easiest way get them out way is once professor is done discussing it his lectures go do them immediately plus you have unlimited attempts same thing with hw assignments as you learn content do hw because thats how hw questions progress i personally havent done practise worksheets but my friends told me they were super helpful so do those if youre not getting good grades first few tips above there are no final exams but lot beginning contents will come back last few chapters so do not forget content two lowest grades your test quizzes will automatically turn into 100s but you have complete practice quizzes if you want access tqs hw are marked strictly so try resemble your answers his lecture notes because he shows you how answer them detail check your rubric as well this may seem like lot but if you give about 1 hr minimum 3 times week after his lectures you can get lot work done instead waiting till last minute his tips

unlimited attempts get correct answer however when you get question wrong it does not tell you which questions you got wrong so its hard know what area you are lacking knowledge which questions reattempt thus its tedious cycle retrying each question until you get all questions correct furthermore we had tests every single week that was available monday wednesday but you would not be able

something do this course it was never ending', 'be honest i really didnt enjoy this course at first since dr chaurasia just did examples as supplements explain notes many parts quizzes werent taught at all but he took feedback students after first few lectures changed his teaching better encompass students which made understanding lectures easier i personally found tutorials especially helpful

content discussions but hate it passionately as well because you quite literally will not receive 60 worth your final grades participation final paper final exam brabazon stated that this course is

student give this course fair honest review i will go into it with plenty depth topic wise i was hooked i enjoyed learning about protests criminal law actors gender children youth justice etc honestly lectures were quite relaxed very helpful midterm exams no lecture slides which many students disliked but i actually found this helpful because weekly agenda this course is attending 1 lecture 2 break out group then 3 take notes you will ace exams breakdown assignments were okay but i found marking be all over place incohesive as strict or student i was surprised with my low 80 grade both written

that lectures were not recorded if you were sick there was no way other than sharing notes receive lecture content again noting that lecture slides ceased exist overall nice content but extremely disorganized received lower marks than i was expecting yet this was easiest ls course i have ever taken professor seemed make this course scary no reason stating lecture 1 that this course would be

i spent countless hours every week trying understand everything truthfully quite but it i understood after working towards it i was never terrible at math but there were those units that i definitely found harder than others i didnt use textbook past midterm because my profs notes stopped paralleling content which made it difficult teach myself because yes you need do that this whole course keith killed me i tried so hard being respectful my emails but he almost broke me so heres thing about him he gives good notes that he posts about lessons study those if you can those are what he bases exams quizzes after but he also encourages students work through problems their own first try understand material which yes seems like good idea but he also has policy refusing help students with questions when his quizzes are open but theres always quiz open available so this man never answers questions which is extremely wrong because we as students are paying him teach how do we learn if he doesnt help 10 10 recommend investing chegg over textbook this course dont be shy quizlet trust me when i say its much better investment midterm tip is throw multiple choice questions past quizzes into doc so you can just use ctrl f or command f search through questions if you work your butt off youll get through but make study groups step away your social anxiety just do it cause dude everyone is suffering this class but asking questions between one another will be life saver exams are usually 15 m c marks 70 marks or so problems', 'not super difficult but pretty useless material', 'if you

been learned 2 hours using google searches or hour reading textbook this course if you bother buying it most interesting thing was when we had guest lecturers that was actually interesting also with

find it boring difficulty do math however set up course with mark oremus with 2 assignments that contain most calculation based information final that was just information memorization was really easy

alright course she added information she had mentioned incredibly briefly exam shocked our entire class', 'not very useful information or skills were learned this course unless youre planning become

explore new software if i have my favourite part about course was fact that along with learning technical skills it also teaches you how be resourceful course is very well organized professor barbara

available help you through assignments', 'took this course online during winter 2021 term with barbara daly it was pretty easy usually fun course learned lot about microsoft word proper design

that is pretty easy do as well however it isnt like i wont put any effort ill do fine youll still wanna put some effort discussions project since they are meant be reflections get good mark

passion immunology it would be really difficult study long hours it takes do well also you need go lecture some later lectures dr dixon does not write much slides really only 2 3 molecules giant flowchart with 20 30 molecules may be important lecture hell point this out but you would be lost if you just looked at slides lab is pretty easy overall you have write short lab report each lab 5

get 75 get full marks final exam', 'this course was very poorly organized dr dixon took over lectures after first midterm it felt like different course did not connect well earlier material katzenback

specific if you like memorizing 50 cytokines what they do their receptors this course is you otherwise would not recommend unless you need it as prerequisite that case good luck', 'absolute worst course you can take simply because how poorly it was organized she did not teach anything useful or important expected us know details ideas concepts we never covered class could not follow along with

like convexity n cubes discontinuities q as well as partitions i struggled with lectures before looking up immediately understanding live or person lectures would allow you actually ask questions

lectures would start writing proofs down pull some random delta out nowhere would not bother explain why he chose that value delta or why we couldnt pick different value delta over one he chose

better off just going 351 without 333 since this course did not help at all i felt as i have not learned anything this class it is disapointing since i was most excited this class last term but that

would be copyright infringement wtf so he literally gave us 2 seconds write down solution simultaneously try listen his reasoning move through material as fast as possible poor move considering copyright infringement excuse is probably just reason him not post drop everyones marks as result with such smart people i have no idea why you would do this maybe its programs business model',

be difficult understand these new concepts there were only like 1 practice question per concept question is hard so its really hard study them you really need do your questions second part course was focused concepts our final had like no calculation calculators werent needed near end it was very strange midterm was lot calculation though your final you need memorize everything take good notes what he says class you really have go class finally rogo snaked us end we all dropped like 10 maybe average was too high 76 midterm or assignments average was too high he marked our final exams really

most time talking about china though i dont know if thats actually because he was chinese or if china just has more history talk about any case we spent 4 weeks china 2 weeks each korea japan then 1

graded isnt that ironic considering this is geography crosslist anyways aside point building off her inability use learn she never posts powerpoints before class other words you have scramble keep up with her as she goes pointless tangents rants so forth its impossible know what study come time final or midterm above all else she is incredibly abrasive condescending towards class if you go see her

is over you have just bunch shitty notes as you try type like mad man class get everything you are forced go 3 hour class where about 70 time she is talking about irrelevant things making it impossible pay attention her inability use technology is outstanding it takes atleast 10 minutes every class her set up her slides projector with help it almost every time learn is her worst enemy as she doesnt even post marks there instead we have wait over hour after class get physical copies back which is nightmare with over 200 people enrolled her lack organization entire course is so ironic

have take this course wait till someone else teaches it', 'dr elliott is extremely unorganized clearly doesnt seem know how even use learn system properly she doesnt post slides students follow learn

really difficult earn good mark this course participation accounted 20 your mark despite that i never missed class participate discussions i did not get good mark i am baffled by subjectivity this course how assignments are marked i usually dont understand why i lose marks overall it accumulates my overall bad mark i am disappointed terms course content it is quite similar sociology but readings are lengthy written by anthropologists that are difficult read at same time hard write if you would like explore social issues themes written description i suggest you take soc or something

have assignment due that lecture that week his notes are long dense quiz questions are never broad topics or main points but instead are usually nitty gritty he is fast respond my email but is not

very rewarding when finished some really fun material such as lagrangian hamiltonian mechanics special relativity beginning is pretty much phys 121 with slightly heavier math there s some vector calc

much better mark it as well', 'i saw review another material science course me 115 that really embodied this course as well so i will use some it here just add few points here there so you know what makes this course really stand out this is theeeee worst course i have ever taken most hated class 2a my cohort lectures were sooo boring useless which motivated most class never show up textbook is completely useless as well just pages pages conceptual ideas then just bunch numerical calculations you have no idea how do often they require you make wild assumptions or just happen memorize certain values about property you would normally look chart book barely i mean barely skims topic then it tells you google rest yourself tutorials are literally questions textbook which usually does not relate what it spoke about labs were poorly designed students are sometimes required buy or search household items carry out experiment lab manual always presents cheap flimsy experimental setup form picture with very little organized comprehensible instruction how actually set it up carry out procedure which just course led way too many experimental errors thus least accurate data possible many large concepts that were repeatedly mentioned throughout course didnt show up once exams meanwhile memorizing random things like type material that reading lenses are made is required test funnily enough such random facts are only shown one time this one slide this one lecture minute there are even questions exam requiring you use brand new equations youve never used before found somewhere slides possibly tiniest writing with zero explanation as what each variable equation means so ultimately even if you manage self teach yourself entire course you may still get royally screwed top it off this teacher will ask you purchase anything his class including software with no notice day class prof waltzes telling us we need buy peer grading software 30 submit our assignments oh first assignment which we were also just hearing about was due following day hell did you realize that i said peer grading software so yes students are marking evaluating other students work providing feedback those evaluations end prof tas will still mark your work bring down grade that students gave you thus making this platform complete waste your time money particularly since there are platforms that other teachers use at this school do same thing free no surprise that many students were failing his quizzes especially when there were so few questions quiz do even lesser time one question easily translates 4 5 10 your grade what makes this better is that calculation questions you have get exact number order get answer correct so if you have 0 0025 he has 0 0026 you just lost 10 did i mention that if you cumulatively fail quizzes you fail course he will automatically fail you all grades aside quiz grades become null void they won t count towards your final average so you my friend would have double wasted your money that software all materials you bought labs all time effort you spent doing other course work would have been nothing just case you are hoping curve get that out your mind right now there is no curve however you may be selected interview where you get 20 mins make speech or be grilled with questions about different topics that made up quiz you failed if you do well interview who knows you may get 3 added your failed quiz this is one time thing so i hope you wont fail more than one quiz i sure hope that if you do fail one that it was only like 47 that quiz enjoy', 'if i didnt have mayer as my prof this course would have been hella easy fun probably really useful sadly i didnt learn much this course it was literally just pass his course this course should have taught some pretty fundamental stuff that youd use later ex picking biomaterials stuff', 'subject itself is pretty interesting but course was extremely shallow i barely learnt anything exams were difficult score high grades all wrong reasons midterm was excruciating easy content coverage was realistically crammable within 2h but there were so few questions large weighting such that mistakes magnified incredulous amount e g straight forward calculations that take 5min can translate 5 overall course grade final exam was full mistakes we were forbidden asking any questions whatsoever there was content prof explicitly said would not be covered tas were super nice understanding situation but there was only so much they could do stopped going lectures after first two just read textbooks course overall grades were not low but experience was borderline unbearable', 'similar what others have experienced content prof explicitly said would not be covered showed up

unnecessarily difficult but actual concepts werent too hard grasp', 'interesting course not too difficult', 'this was weekly seminar it didnt count as credit most people stopped coming after first one or 2 weeks however i thought it was pretty useful i was shy lol so i didnt talk profs lot but they were there at many seminars were really nice encouraged us talk them if you do keep going seminars

that bad there are clear examples it being used class theyll recommend that you memorize whole bunch derivatives integrals but you dont actually use 90 them entire course it gives good foundation

long hard trivial', 'not best way present this type course material', 'i took this online boy does it suffer it entire course is vague notes where youll have draw your own conclusions context order do quizzes problem is most time context isnt there its like trying make pancakes with nothing but flour no lectures which course desperately needs because as youd expect most people taking geophysics

salary player based their court performance really fun stuff mark boosters got 98 both them only work it like 2 days exams midterm final was all mc lot theory it has lot concepts that can be easily searched textbook but also has many microeconomics econ 101 concepts so make sure you review that stuff i didnt do amazing these mainly because i only spent 7 days course throughout entire semester final thoughts this was extremely fun course i got 85 with spending just 7 days combined throughout entire semester this course if you want low work load okay high marks then this course is worth it

extremely particular answers discussions if you didnt give those then you didnt get greatest marks also apparently drawing personal experiences was not correct although it does not state that anywhere also doing more than required posts would result marks being deducted i guess only good thing about this course is that work load was small but i still wish i had taken another random elective i ended

expect get rewarded your efforts dont expect learn anything might as well do bare minimum do his stupid deliverables focus actual courses also prototyping course we only spent like 2 weeks actually prototyping rest this dumb course was just completing useless deliverables that take crazy amount time dont actually help with design you may do poorly no matter how hard you try also just dont try

how this course fits macc program its essentially online course but i cannot gather any interests it since readings teachings assignments are useless readings do not reinforce required work i did all my assignments without having read anything teachings were also not necessary since i did not attend single lecture fact that there were literally no expectations students show up or care since youre capped at 80 is big turnoff students readings were lengthy boring outdated not interesting at all most assignments are full typos as if someone came up with them last minute entire course is focused such niche area law yet its so simple that i can essentially do entire course 1 week most students did their submissions by first half course did nothing thus learned nothing 2nd half instructor made little efforts make us learn instructor fails invoke our interests course he doesnt care about our well being either instructor refuses any regrades claims that hes busy declines meetings with students who wish improve despite only teaching 2 courses if you cannot commit teach due side projects or research then dont teach our tuition macc is high we do not want course that adds no value our professional careers students who marked our assignments papers are not even waterloo students fairness objectivity grading is serious flaw this course there was absolutely no feedback provided when you get marks taken off people often ask are these tas even qualified mark our assignments i bet as macc student we write better than them yet they are taking marks off grammar other unknown reasons every class macc students repeatedly complain charters that we dont understand his rationale capping everyone at 80 if we deserve 100 theres no way improve any further then we deserve 100 forced distribution system placed upon class really discourages students who wanted work hard students have mentality that no matter what you do youre going get 80 anyways students who do all readings spent hours researching compiling gets same mark as student who crammed everything 1 hour lack fairness further destroys any remaining value that is left this course', 'our year lectures were mostly designed organized by bradley pompom he was clear very academic explains really well he works hard tries his best make sure everything is fair we often see him updating stuff at midnight his feedback

is by far most bs course ive ever taken saf especially with zamal teaching it acc685 is cpa elective is supposed be much enhanced version acc680 yet zamal only focuses strategy part nothing cost or quants course is entirely full bs simple strategy case that could have been taught 1 lecture is split into 3 full classes you literally learn nothing cases are outdated long made no sense because it was not written cpa purposes but mba harvard ivey zamal is actually very lazy he makes no effort updating course material claims that nothing has changed over past 20 years therefore we use slides 20 years ago also he tries bs his way out whenever he doesnt know answers which occurs often many us took this course because we heard it was bird this is not case this year what happened is that zamal was too lazy he didnt change midterm final previous year so entire class year before got 90s our year he totally screwed us over by making 2 hard cases midterm gave us all low marks participation assignment exams by way he makes c only 90 so even if you get c your case which is under cpa standards perfect score you wont get 100 your case hes effectively capping your performance at 90 max youll get he makes rc 70 when its supposed be 75 this course does not help you prepare your cfe if you think youre going take pm role then just spend more effort 680 with nancy janet because you learn more them there are not many pm role cases available since cfe started 2015 but he makes no effort make it better he could have asked nancy used some her cases or modified them or just use cpa cases but no

took it because it was prerequisite syde544 but that really was not necessary however it wasnt painful course complete', 'was taught course by extremely passionate prof zunic who helped immensely understanding quite difficult readings course although course is extremely reading heavy assessments only 3 essays whole course no final allowed extreme choice what youll be writing about since you can see choices ahead time you can basically just only read about what your essay will be skip everything else', 'unfortunately i found this course be meh 80 90 slides per week did not thrill me paired with online lectures person class person sessions were class meets felt like waste time two tests felt like they quizzed very specific almost irrelevant parts course versus major themes written assignments are easy do well but tests no i did really enjoy professor though so that would be positive', 'this course is interesting important unique i recommend it other students because there are no other courses like it at uw it will really enrich your perspective queer trans studies queerness transness more broadly if you are interested social justice this course is must take', 'there are lot readings so try stay top them otherwise assignments are kind intense assignments were also really structured basically only focus readings course material super interesting course', 'this course

computational biomechanics useful but if youre interested sports engineering ymmv professor is not really familiar with any software covered opensim 3d slicer febio so dont expect actually learn how do anything unless youre prepared self teach assignments involve following youtube tutorials with no direction professor so you could literally learn this entire course your own', 'took this online with georgia whalen as it was asl level two it was definitely more challenging than level one it was taught exact same format as level one homework assignments reflection grades final video assignment final ab dialogue final video assignment was different than level one because instead retelling story textbook you had tell story your own which i personally found be easier course was taught asynchronously but they did have weekly optional live lectures they were all recorded but if you actually want learn asl i highly recommend taking it person rather than online', 'i either designed or helped design majority this course i guarantee its most fun easiest cs course that all cs major students take hope you like it 3', 'topic 3 intro data analytics', 'not sure if i liked this course yet definitely helpful if youre looking apply graduate school has interesting learning process it is lot work though so careful how you manage it you really get out it what you put i personally learned lot about my subject found it good writing practice just heavy work load', 'this course was not as interesting as i hoped it would be results are interesting but proofs are too complicated be intuitive so i didnt feel like i understood most it very well final was 100 memorization which was awful']\n"
